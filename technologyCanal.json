            "description": "UPDATE - I got the job!  Well, not the Web Developer job, which is only a bit of a bummer, because I got the job I was applying for initially which required the business case.  It's a Career Development position, and it's a very big deal.  What's more, I don't think I would have been successful without y'all.\n\nSeriously, though, I'm just so dang happy and thankful right now.  I want to give y'all a huge thank you, and a big ol' hug.  Your comments and input were so beyond helpful in helping me think through my presentation and make my business case and application a success.  I don't cry often, but I'm seriously tearing up.  If any of y'all are in Denver any time soon, beers are on me.\n\n**UPDATE 2 - Even more awesome good news.** This truly is the last update, I promise.\n\nI met with our CEO yesterday to discuss some of the details of my new position.  In the Career Development Program I'll be doing 3-4 month rotations in different departments (including IT), really getting my hands dirty and working on whatever project that department has going on at the time.  My CEO mentioned that there is a possibility that we could be given job offers in a particuarl department if the manager of that department has an opening and wants to offer it to us.  \n\nAfter the meeting, he asks me to stay behind a moment.  He says that he agreed with my business case 100%, and that I had helped him realize how huge of an unnecessary risk we were taking.  He agreed with my financial analysis (including suggested outlays a Web Designer salary and software), and he asked me to get on the calendar of the head of our IT department and present my business case to him.\n\n**Now here comes the fun part.**  He also said that they will most likely start me working in the IT department on my proposed project, if the head of IT gives his go-ahead.  He also mentioned that, if things go well, it could very quickly turn into the full-time job I proposed.\n\nSo right now, I'm totally stoked.  With r/WebDesign's help, I've managed to make a change within my company and provide for an environment where we'll be able to move forward winning the technology battle.  There are so many exciting design opportunities for this job it makes my head spin.  I know that things will be slow going at first, but with the CEO's backing we'll be able to look at implementing many of the suggestions I made in business case.  I owe everyone who provided input a huge debt of grattitude.  The CEO, the VP of the bank I work for, and one of the managers in IT have been asking about a glut of different projects, including Wikis, message boards, etc.  It'll be a lot to do, if I eventually end up in that position, but I'm so excited for the challenges that are to come.  I'm sure I'll have much more to discuss with everyone here in r/WebDesign and r/WebDev, and I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nPersonally, this is a really big win in way that is completely impossible for me to put into words.  A year and a half ago, I was homeless.  I lived in whatever hotel was close by when I could afford it, and slept in my car at a highway rest stop when I couldn't.  I've obviously moved up quite a bit since then, but with your help I feel as though I've taken the last step to really help secure a sound future.  With that in mind, I made the leap and finally paid off the engagement ring I had on layaway at the jewelry store.  I'll be proposing to my girlfriend this weekend, as I finally feel like I'll be able to provide for our family for years to come (even if I don't end up in the Web Developer position, I'll still end up somewhere in the company with relatively equal pay).\n\nMaybe I'm being overly sentimental here.  Maybe I'm making too much out of this.  If I am, quite frankly I don't care.  I'm beyond happy at the moment, and want to share it with the world.  \n\nAgain, I cannot thank all of you enough.  \n\n------------------------------------------\nORIGINAL POST\n\nLast week [I posted a question](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdesign/comments/15qay1/my_employer_has_told_me_to_stop_coding_anything/) about what you would do if your employer put you in the same situation as me-- having to use only FrontPage's WYSIWYG editor for all your design purposes.  I got some great responses, so first and foremost-- thanks everyone.  I really appreciate the feedback.\n\nA while back I was given the opportunity to apply for a career development program within my company.  It's essentially a way for my company to identify talented hourly employees and give them rotations in different departments to find out where they would work best and get them moved up.   A couple of weeks ago I found out that I had passed the first round of interviews, and would be given the chance to present a business case on a topic of my choice for the final interview.  This eight-person panel included my supervisor, supervisors from multiple technical and non-technical departments, and our company's CEO.\n\nI agonized what to write about for quite a while.  Truth be told, I've been banging the drum for improvements to our internal communications systems and intranet development for almost four years.  I didn't want to be seen as a one-trick pony, but the more I thought about it the more it became clear to me that this was the most important topic I could discuss.  Furthermore, I might never get to present a topic to our CEO again; this would be one shot to make sure that the man who had absolute power to make a change was given enough information to do so.\n\nI took a lot of thoughts and concepts discussed in the previous thread and did some additional research to come up with a business plan for scrapping FrontPage as our development tool and hiring a full-time Web Developer using modern software to develop a new internal communications architecture.  \n\n**In the business case, I discussed at length the dangers of using FrontPage -- an obsolete, unsupported software to design our web pages.  I talked about how the coding techniques used by FrontPage aren't supported by modern web browsers, which is a huge problem as our company is planning on moving to IE9 as part of a larger upgrade process in the coming months.  I discussed how security patches and browser upgrades could have a potentially devastating impact on our business if they brought down FrontPage or our intranet sites.  I discussed alternative design tools and options, such as SharePoint, Dreamweaver, Expression Web, etc.  In short, a lot of what was discussed in that thread made it into the final presentation.**\n\nFrom the start, I could tell that I hit a chord with the CEO.  The more I talked about the danger of continuing to use FrontPage as our development tool and the inadequacies of our current system-- as well as my vision for the future-- the more interest he showed.  In the end I recommended $90,000 to pay for the Web Developer and software.  We don't need any hardware upgrades, as we already have the right machinery in place to make this work.  By the time I was done, the CEO was nodding in agreement with just about everything I said.  It was only a ten minute presentation, but I could tell I had made a huge impact with him.\n\nThey told me that they'd let us know early this week about who they were hiring for the position, but I'm more proud of the presentation than I am for being up for a nice promotion.  Who knows, maybe they'll end up offering me the Web Developer position instead, right?\n\nAnyway, I wanted to thank y'all for your great thoughts and input.  You were really a big help to me in developing the concepts behind my business case.  I'm hoping things turn out for the best-- if I hear anything about the results of the presentation in the next few days, I'll post an update back here.\n\n**TL;DR - Last week I posed a question on r/webdesign. Y'all are awesome and answered it.  Said answers lead to business case, which I presented as part of a job interview to our CEO.  He seemed really into it, and changes may be forthcoming.  And oh yeah, I got the friggin' job!  (See above).  Y'all are great!**\n\nEDIT:  Made some minor grammar changes and added the meat of my presentation for those who might be interested.",

Border Image, Text Shadow, CSS Columns, CSS Gradients, CSS Transitions . . . the list goes on, and there is simply no excuse by IE. \n\n2) IE 7 and IE 8 are still very popular.  Because IE has been so late to the game, there are many many IE users out there that break HTML 5 and CSS 3 all together.  \n\n3) IE 9 still doesn't support advanced client-side Web development like offline applications and Web workers.  And it is still buggy.  It will still crash completely by something as silly as an poorly closed table.  (http://crashie8.com/)  Now, while designers and developers SHOULD try to avoid errors like poorly closed tables, if a mistake is made in the communication between separate design and dev teams, IT SHOULDN'T CRASH THE WHOLE DAMN CLIENT!!!!\n\nIE 9 support for CSS3 / HTML 5 is too little too late.  IE is still a shit client, and it is our duty as Web experts to try to educate people and help them transition to a modern, full-featured browser.  \n\nSo, for the love of all that is holy, stop defending IE because \"they are trying.\"  \n</rant>",

I‘ve noticed people on here love threads about other peoples experiences & resources.     \n\n\nIt seems like almost every day a new thread appears in the list with people asking for advice how to start, where to go, what to learn.   \n\n\n\nSo I thought, why not open a new thread - but instead of asking for advice I‘ll provide you with the resources *I personally* use when designing & coding a new website.  \n\n\n\nPlease feel free to contribute your own experiences, and your best tips!\n\n**1.)\tSetting up the basic framework**\n\nDepending on what the new website is going to be about, this is something you will probably handle differently.\n\nThe [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) is a pretty solid way to get all the basic HTML & CSS going. It provides you with almost all the things that would normally take you alot of valuable time to code. Go check it out!\n\nAdditionally, I love to use the [1140px CSS grid](http://cssgrid.net/). It makes things so much easier. And it‘s even responsive down to mobile phones! Simply apply .colum-classes to your code. It‘s magic!\n\nNo one should ever have to write a basic grid by his own again.\n\nOne last thing about getting started. It‘s always best to reset your browser styles with a [reset.css](http://www.cssreset.com/) file. Resetting can save you alot of headache, trust me. \n\n\n**2.) \tThe design**\n\nWhen I started looking into webdesign a few years ago I often found myself spending (sometimes wasting) an incredible amount of time trying to design some basic patterns for backgrounds. You don‘t have to do that.\n\nI absolutely love using [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/)! They provide you with a huge collection of amazing patterns. Dark, light, striped, squared. You name it, it‘s there. And the best thing: it‘s free!\n\n\n**3.)\tThe Fonts**\n\nGeorge Everet once said „Webdesign is 95% typography“. Well, you don‘t have to agree, but the fonts  you use often decide if a website is „really good!“ or just „good“. \n\nA good place to start looking for fonts to use is [Google Webfonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts/).\n\nIf you don‘t find what you‘re looking for, try [DaFont](http://www.dafont.com/) or [AbstractFonts](http://www.abstractfonts.com/)!\n\nFound your perfect font, but it‘s only a „.ttf“ and you don‘t really know what to put in your .css-file to apply it to your website?\n\nAn incredibly helpful tool that helps you convert your font to all common file-types and even generates the css-entries for you is: [Fontsquirrel - @font-face generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator)! Check it out!  \n\n**4.)\tThe inspiration**\n\nSo you can code super-clean HTML & CSS-Code with your eyes blind-folded? That‘s awesome! But it‘s not just about the code, your site has to look good too!\n\nIf you‘re like me, you sometimes need some inspiration to get the actual design-work going. Here are a couple of sites that are the first place I look for new ideas:\n\n* [Behance.net](http://www.behance.net/search?field=102)\n* [CSS-Designawards](http://cssdesignawards.com/)\n* [The Best Designs](http://www.thebestdesigns.com/)\n* [Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com/)\n* [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/)\n* [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/)\n* [Patterntap](http://patterntap.com/)\n* [siiimple](http://www.siiimple.com)\n\nYou still have to come up with your own ideas of course, and you should definitely not just copy and paste somebody elses code. Still, looking at other peoples work helps alot in finding out what you are going to do, or what you‘re not going to do!\n\n\n**5.)\tOther great resouces**\n\nWhen you design & code websites, you may not have all smartphones and tablets with you to test if your code is responsive to different screen-resolutions. But that shouldn‘t be a problem!\n\n* [Responsive Design Bookmarklet](http://responsive.victorcoulon.fr/) (very cool)\n* [Responsive Design test](http://mattkersley.com/responsive/)\n\n[Here](http://www.awwwards.com/best-css-code-snippets-sites.html) is a GREAT place to look for code-snippet websites, especially when it comes to HTML & CSS. You don‘t always have to go through the trouble of finding out how to write a nice-looking button with CSS!\n\n„Animations,.. you need Flash for that, right?“ - Wrong!\n\n[Dan Eden](http://daneden.me/animate/) created a great collection of super cool css / jQuery animations. Check it out!\n\nHave you ever wondered where people get all the cool image sliders from? Yeah, me too! Here are my two favorite jQuery-image-sliders:\n\n* [nivo-slider](http://nivo.dev7studios.com/)\n* [flex-slider](http://flexslider.woothemes.com/index.html)\n\nSo there you have it. This is by far not a complete guide to webdesign, and I have not given any actual coding-advice on purpose. Like I said, I just wanted to give you some examples on how *I personally* start out with designing & coding a new website.\n\nThere are many helpful tools out there, but you have to find them first! I‘m sure I have forgotten about many, so please feel free to contribute your own resources and tips!\n\n\nDon‘t know what to write? \n\n* What‘s the first thing you do when you start a new website from scratch?\n* Do you use CSS-Grids or Frameworks? \n* Where do *you* get your inspiration from?\n* Any secret tips that you would like to share? \n* Disagree with something on my list? Tell me!\n\n",

            "description": "*To the mods:  I apologize if this is better suited for r/WebDev.  If you feel that it would be better suited there, please let me know.*\n\nI work for a major, very large, to-remain-nameless corporate entity, maintaining their internal corporate communications.  Part of this means designing, building, and maintaining the company's internal websites.  \n\nBefore coming into this job, my background was in convergent journalism-- I can write, shoot and produce video, code websites, design for web and print, etc., etc.  I have a very solid knowledge of all your basic web programming languages and SSL's to boot.  However, this job, historically, was very much a non-technical position.  The person who did this job before me had little to no actual coding knowledge, and the company relied on Frontpage as their web maintenace and design tool.  Because of Frontpage's severe limitations, I mostly ingore it and just do my own codeing in Notepad and validate the code through the W3C validation service.  I do, of course, make sure that that I've taken all steps to properly record and document my code.\n\nSo here's the crux of the problem:  the company has decided that, should I leave the position, having pages that can't be maintained using their current system (IE Frontpage) would be a liability.  They'd be forced to hire someone with the technical skill to understand and maintain pages based off the coding alone-- a difficult task, but not an impossible one for a decent coder who has access to my documentation.  The company has requested that I only design and maintain our website using Frontpage's WYSIWYG editor.\n\nI have several problems with this.  First and foremost, much of what I've already coded can't be maintained using Frontpage's WYSIWYG.  It simply doesn't have the ability to understand DIV formats, and using any coding strategies developed after 2000 is pretty much a no-no.  Secondly, I am often ask to come up with technical solutions to problems that I can easily solve, but require a coding solution.  I hate to tell my company \"I can do this, but because of the restrictions you've placed on me, it's not possible.\"  I can't see any way around this, though.\n\nSo how would you handle this?  Is it moral for me to continue to provide techinical solutions to problems, where the solution is within my ability, even if my company has told me not to do so?  How should I go about addressing the issue with using Frontpage's WYSIWYG editor to code pages with complex DIV structures-- something that apparently just cannot be done?  Has anyone else been in a similar scenario, and if so, how did you handle it?  I'm at my wit's end here.\n\nTL;DR - Company doesn't want the liability of having well-coded web pages, and has limited me to using Frontpage's WYSIWYG editor.  I cannot do my job using only this tool.  What should I do?",

I think he might have a hard time signing a piece of paper that says \"Yes, I agree to the risk of the site being unable to function in new versions of major browsers\" or \"Yes, I agree to the risk of being unable to update the site because a Windows patch broke Frontpage and because it is obsolete, Microsoft aren't going to update Frontpage to work again\".\n",

This idea has been suggested before by numerous people over the years, but I'm not sure if its ever been tried. \n\nI want to see what the effect of hiding the karma scores has on the quality of discussion on reddit. I often feel that once a comment hits -1 or -2, it succumbs to the mob rule of the hivemind and gets downvoted regardless of it's content. As the only modifications we can make are to the stylesheet, this will only be achievable by hiding the scores, rather than removing them. This has benefits, as the ranking system will still work and comments that do reach the negative threshold will still get automatically minimized.\n\nI was thinking of running it for a month or so, and it would require a certain amount of participation on your part. You could still see karma scores if you use RES or by disabling the custom stylesheet, but this would obviously skew the results if lots of people did it. On a more positive note, we're all web designers here, this sort of thing is our bread and butter. I'll be looking to the community for feedback and your thoughts as the experiment goes on, the 'results' will pretty much be your opinions.

                    "comment": "I'm a self-employed (re: own my own company that's really just me, though sometimes I hire out for things) designer/developer in upstate New York. Last year I made ~80K, this year I'm on track to do about the same (4 months in, ~25K so far).\n\nRe: How much to charge -- this is entirely dependent. Location, competition, skill level, experience. I can say from experience, with all of those things considered, that my rates (in comparison to my location and competition) are quite low -- small biz websites tend to be 1500-4000, logos tend to be a few hundred, same for print work. You can still do well without charging a ton.\n\nBasically, you just have to be able to have a fast turnover. Here are some tips:\n\n* Vet clients: don't just take every job. However, don't base your decision entirely on something like whether you are passionate about the subject matter. What's more important is the client and how easy/difficult they are to work with. A difficult client can make a job take 2, 3, maybe 4 times as long as the same type of job with an easy client. Basically, this has to do with how you get along with them, how down to earth they are, how open to ideas it seems they are, etc. Be on the constant lookout for red flags. You don't want to work with someone who believes they have design skills, who seems strict about expectations, etc. **Case in point: Working only for clients you have a good rapport with will mean faster turnaround (thus more work faster) and happier people on both sides.**\n* Have a workflow: get into a groove with each type of job. Know exactly what you're going to do and how you're going to go about it. For example, I always mock-up websites in photoshop first and get an OK on design before writing a line of code.\n* Work smart, come up with constants: This is an extension of the workflow thing. For example, I could probably decrease (re: better) my turnaround time by using cookie-cutter layouts and such, but I think it would be crossing the line (the \"make money\" / \"be proud of my work\" line). What does make sense, though, is to set yourself up for success. For example, I have my own \"blank\" wordpress theme that I install on every Wordpress site I make. This way I start with a blank slate (but one that I'm comfortable with) every time.\n* Get paid first, always, and have a schedule: make it clear to clients that you take a deposit. Do not do an ounce of work without that deposit. For websites, make it clear that you will not launch the website without final payment. I cannot stress enough how much that has changed how quickly you will get paid. If you launch a website without final payment, the client has no incentive to pay you. They want their site launched, they will pay you.\n* Try to build relationships with similar-industry colleagues. I have 3 clients who aren't *really* clients in the traditional sense, which is to say that I don't design *their* work. I design *their clients'* work. One is an SEO firm, one a design firm (I do development), the last is a social media marketing firm. This is helpful for having consistent work.\n\nI host websites for clients, but not by way of \"my own\" server or anything like that. A lot of host services offer \"reseller\" accounts. I use GoDaddy's -- basically you can sell (and upcharge) the GoDaddy suite of products, but under your own branding. You have control over everything. As for price, just check around and see what makes sense. I upcharge hosting by quite a bit because I offer it as an add-on service. A client who is savvy enough to grab their own hosting doesn't need your help. The kind of client who wants you to host it is more likely to call you for changes and updates, and will also not feel comfortable calling customer support themselves (at least, this has been my experience).\n\nServices: everything design / development oriented. Mainly: logos, websites, print work.\n\nAs I mentioned, I make the money mostly by having good work and fast turnaround. You really can't do better than having those two things in your arsenal.\n\nFinding clients: I haven't sought work in about 2 years. Again, this is where having good work comes into play. You will get references. Point #5 above adds to this.\n\nI hope this helps.",

I personally recommend hostgator because their prices are the best for the quality and support. You need a guarantee of 100% uptime which realistically no one can give you, but hostgator is a good bet. \n\nThe best part of reselling, you know how much your clients need so you can slim down their hosting package to fit their needs. This lets you host (usually) more clients on your account! How much to charge? Anyone and I mean anyone will pay $5/month for hosting no questions asked and you will still make a minimal profit from it, but really you're just giving them a good deal. After that, you just look at how much your customer can afford. Once again $10/month is a safe bet and easy sell. $20/month gets you a huge profit, since resellers go for $25/month, and can be pulled off for the rich clients but don't get me wrong, you will be ripping them off. \n\nKeep in mind your reseller package does have resource limitations which hostgator lets you easily monitor. It works great for html sites or blogs, not really forums or highly interactive ones. \n\nI highly recommend against go daddy for the following reasons:\n1. shitty website and control panel, makes it hard to manage your services\n2. bad company practices, reddit has been up in arms over them before and for good reason\n3. prices are more expensive for shittier quality\n",

I'm in my late 20's, about 10 years into my career. I'm paid well for a client side designer, my USP as a potential employee is my experience and my skill set. I've worked on many, many blue chip, luxury and high street brands as a designer and front-end developer (mainly JS stuff). Being able to design *and* code to a high standard is indispensable.

My current job is awesome so I may stick this one out a little longer.\n\nIt is possible to earn good money without freelancing, but your work must be top notch as there is much more accountability - if you've spent two years at a company you need something to show for it.

Sounds shallow, but no one is paying $100+ an hour for someone who's never done anything of note.\n\nHosting is a mixed bag. You can resell hosting or have them use their own vendor. Remember, once you bring hosting into the mix you're on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It's more stress/work than it's worth for most. \n\nAgain, hosting all depends on what you're offering. There are tons of factors with hosting, honestly way beyond what can be covered here. Do a little reading about the different types of hosting and the advantages/disadvantages of each. Again though, I recommend you leave the hosting to someone who does it full time.\n\nTools are again dependent on your clients and their needs. Many large clients are hesitant to use a free or open source solution for the sole reason that they like having a number to call if something is wrong. It's all in how you sell it and the value you can demonstrate.\n\nI don't freelance nearly enough to make 75k+ a year. You're going to be earning every last penny of that 75k for a while unless things really take off. \n\nFinding clients depends on the type of clients you want to pursue. To start you can join your local chamber of commerce and attend mixers/meetings/etc. There are a lot of sites for freelancing online but generally work goes to the lowest bidder. You may need to \"pay your dues\" in doing relatively unexciting or less than glamorous projects. Design students will downvote me for this, but you're not going to start off building microsites for Red Bull.\n\nUndergoing any business venture on your own is a serious amount of work, and it's imperative to go into it recognizing that the real value comes in having complete control over your business and hours and not through being able to keep 100% of the profits for yourself or working less. Good luck, it takes a mix of natural talent and the ability to sell yourself, something creatives sometimes feel uncomfortable doing.",

I started a solo agency this year to help me grow the business.\n\nI have a tall list of clients and they keep growing by the month through referrals.\n\nHowever, I do not enjoy building websites anymore. I do not enjoy sitting for long hours, building websites(whether from scratch or with templates) , the unlimited revisions from clients, blah blah. I could hire people to do the work but I’m not so impressed by the quality of their works so I have no interest in pursuing that at this time.\n\nI am yet to make the insane millions that the “gurus” talk about but I’ve helped many younger web designers get clients, price properly, etc.\n\nI have a huge bank of templates(proposals, contracts, invoices, decks, etc.) that I use to ‘impress’ clients when communicating my vision for their website, our partnership, etc. \n\nI usually give these templates to the newbies that I help for free. They seem to love them. From their feedbacks, the templates are amazing and have helped them elevate their career in some respect. I’m glad. \n\nI think I can sell these templates and make an honest living while focusing on my little family and giving my little girl the best childhood of her life. \n\nI understand I’ll have to create content consistently and build an audience before I can make a living but I don’t mind doing this at all.\n\nIs this new business direction viable? Am I asking the right people for help? Is there anything I need to know before I make this jump? Is anyone else tired of building websites and wanna explore other ideas? How did you think about this and what did you do? I could use some help right now. Thanks. ",

It’s perfectly natural, after several years, to start seeing patterns across websites, which tends to make the career as a whole feel repetitive and perhaps a bit lifeless.\n\nRegarding whether shifting your business to selling tools/templates to other designers is a viable one – sure it is. But… you’ll have to cut through a fairly significant amount of noise.\n\nThemeforest, Squarespace, Wix, Wordpress all have fairly extensive themes and template libraries, which even if inferior to yours, still have the advantage of being “top of mind” for most people who would use them.\n\nIt can feel promising, when you see a lot of people on Reddit responding positively to your hard-earned advice, and cause you to think that there is a viable business that can be made from it. Unfortunately, most of these people are not yet in a position to financially support anything you would want to charge for.\n\nI’m not saying you shouldn’t do it. Chris Do from “The Futur” has done amazingly well doing this. And there are others who are also seeing success in this space. So it CAN be done. The question you should be asking is… what does that look like for you?\n\nDo you want to start a YouTube channel and become an influencer, or do you not like being on camera?\n\nYou’ve already figured out that you have a passion for helping people.

Sorry if this isn't the best subreddit for this, but I figure a few of you gotta be freelancers and successful, so I'm here to ask for some advice.\n\nBit of a background: I'm in the Army now, and going to finish up my time in about 9 months. Prior to the Army I worked a little, and did freelance web design.\n\nNow then, because I live in a military area where lots of guys retire, but don't want to relocate, they just open up their own little shop. The logo's are tacky and basic, the shop is dirty, and their websites--if they have one at all--are geocities WYSIWYG quality. Many of these guys are prideful, and might not want to veer from the design they made by themselves.\n\nWhat is a good way to approach these businesses and try to explain how cleaning up their image will help, how I can help them, and how much should I charge? (Tricky one, I know. It's relative to the amount of work, but I'm just trying to get a feel for the pricing these days). I have a decent set of skills, and going to build a portfolio to go along with it, but I'm not sure these guys will understand. Being former military, I think I'll have that as an \"in.\"\n\nMy current plan is to develop my portfolio in to a 3-ring binder size for ease of portability, put a portfolio online. Nothing fancy, just clean and showcasing work. And creating 5-10 website templates that these guys can buy and modify to fit their needs. They clearly don't require something completely unique, but that shouldn't stop them from looking professional.\n\nAnyway, If you read all this, thanks for your time and I'd appreciate any feedback, answers or whatnot. I'm just trying to look at this seriously and decide if it's worth pursuing.\n\n**TL;DR - Rusty freelancer needs advice on sprucing up a business plan to cold-call nearby businesses.**",

Design is best when its done with passion, if you push the line, if you try to be original. People is right when they tell you to accept only challenging jobs, and stuff that can make you learn everyday. If it does not come to you, knock on doors, and look for them. We were lucky to work with some big sites in my country and people now take us more seriously. We are about to start two big projects that are challenges, design and codewise. That keeps you motivated.",

They know EXACTLY what they want and how they want it to look, and they are determined to have it look exactly that way. They don't want it simple, they want things to be placed and indented \"JUST SO\" and if it takes nested tables galore, they'll do it.\n\nThese users may or may not be able to learn a bit of HTML, but the trouble is, to get things to look EXACTLY the way they want things to look, they'd have to get decent with HTML. They'd need more than a cursory understanding. So they aren't motivated to learn, because they know they can do it in a WYSIWYG even if the markup comes out a mess.\n\nThe second problem user is the non-tech-savvy user... and these users are likely to mess things up but unlikely to ever even want to learn the basics of HTML.\n\nMy solution to this is to try to build out the site in such a way where users are really only using the WYSIWYG editor for very simple content, e.g. bold, italics, etc. This isn't ALWAYS possible, but a well-designed site, particularly with a good, flexible CMS, can help structure the content in a way to make things as simple for the user as possible.",

You don't want to manage 100 layouts caused by 100 media queries, so let the fluidity of the web do its thang.\n- Use min-width, not max-width for the most part (again part of the mobile-first strategy)\n- Be mindful of media. Start with small images and swap them out for larger resolutions. Check out +Jason Grigsby 's fantastic in-depth look at techniques. http://www.cloudfour.com/responsive-imgs-part-2/\n- Don't lean on the DOM too much. Performance is your #1 feature and manipulating things with JS too much can bog down your site's performance.\n- Don't do 100 backflips to rearrange a bunch of shit. Make sure your design is smart enough to scale up without essentially designing multiple sites. \n- Don't hide content for mobile. Mobile users want to access content just as much as desktop users.\n- Keep hit areas big. Design for touch input methods, and keep in mind that desktop users can benefit from increased hit areas as well. \n\n\n**Discuss**",

Only a couple of times have I worked with a developer that was able to get inside Photoshop\\Fireworks and do what they needed to do, and it was a god sent I'll tell you what. \n\nBeing able to handle the tough back-end work and do a little front-end will only make you more marketable. You don't need to be a designer extraordinaire, but being able to throw together some nice basic graphics, buttons, layouts, and typography will go a long way. Hell, I would just settle for a developer who is just good with slicing up a PSD and optimizing the images when needed.\n\nI would start reading up on the basics of Photoshop, it's surprising how much you can accomplish with a very minimal tool set and knowledge - \n\n- What the tools in the tool bar do\n- Selections and masking\n- How layers work\n- Using layer styles and blending modes\n- Color pallets and Swatches\n- File optimizations and types\n- Basic filters (sharpen, blur, etc)\n\nHere is a list of great tutorials specifically tailored to web design - \n\nhttp://psd.tutsplus.com/articles/web/45-step-by-step-tutorials-on-web-design-with-photoshop/\n\nI also can't recommend the 'tuts' sites enough, they're probably the only good modern tutorial sites out there. I use them whenever I have to get my hands dirty in code ;)",

What really got me up to speed on how to use the tools were the site builds refrenced by Inane_BS-To_Follow. They take you through the steps from empty canvas to completed design and you start to get a feel for how to create things.\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the tools, try designing a few sites, they'll be terrible but keep going.\n\nAdditionally, I really enjoyed Sexy Web Design and the Principles of Beautiful Webdesign. Again like the site builds they walk you through the process of designing a site.\n\nOff the top of my head some topics worth diving into: Typography, Grid Layouts and Color Theory. From there lots of inspiration helps.\n\n**So here's your first task, go do a site build and report back here with the JPG results! (It's ok if it doesn't look exactly like the tut shows you)**",

Say you want to design a very corporate design, but the client has asked for it to be unconventional, which is a situation I find myself in right now.  To get there, I've gone as far to design way out there designs.  Stuff I know the client is going to hate.  But I can then take elements of those designs and tone them down to be a lot more corporate. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say, it never seems to be a straight road from blank canvas to finished design.  There is a lot of twists, loops and curves on that path.\n",

It was especially good learning composition in a group and seeing what other people came up with when presented the same task, but it'll be effective on your own as well.\n\nAlso read up on typography. It may seem like you'll need to study design more then these things, but a lot of web design is also about content placement, text readability and user friendliness.\n\nThe third thing to investigate is color theory, especially in conjunction with use of color in advertising and associations people make with specific colors.\n\nIt is of course necessary that you learn to use Photoshop/Gimp/whatever, but just the knowledge of how to use tools of designing may not be that effective without knowledge of 'the rules' of design and how to break them well, when needed.\n\nEDIT: Something you'll discover sooner or later, but better to discover sooner... When you need to use text as part of an image, use optic kerning. Will be extra useful for free fonts as they don't always have great kerning.",

A real webpage with working examples of what you've built and preferably links to live sites. if you're applying to be a web designer and don't have a personal web portfolio, that's EPIC FAIL bro, your resume is going straight into the trashcan. What you say you haven't done any professional work yet? In the meantime put up your best for fun or student work. You don't have any of that? WTF are you applying to be a web designer. \n\nYou need pro work, and i don't endorse working for free EXCEPT for one thing: legit charities. There's gotta be plenty of worthy non-profits in your local area who have shitty webpages. Start contacting ones you like and offer a free webpage makeover. Bam! you've just gotten some work for your portfolio. \n\n2, you need to make a professional resume, one that's concise and easy to read, with good design. I can't even begin to describe how to write a good resume, so just fucking google it, there's a lot of great resources out there. \n\nDon't spend time making a \"clever design\" that looks like an RPG character sheet, that's a great way to go STRAIGHT INTO THE TRASH CAN. Also a PDF of work you've done is helpful, since some employers insist on that. \n\nAlso, don't list specific versions of software. Nobody gives a crap that you know Photoshop CS1, they just care you know Photoshop. Nothing makes a resume look clueless and out of date like specific version numbers. One exception: HTML5, people really want this right now. \n\n3, Finally, you need to hit up the Egotist site for your area and start applying for design jobs. \n\nhttp://www.thedenveregotist.com/franchise",

Every page more-or-less passes w3's CSS and HTML validators, but there's probably a whole lot of extraneous code on this thing because when I couldn't get something to work right, I tended to just keep on adding code until it came together.\n\nEvery single thing on the site (graphics and all) was made by me, with the exception of the forms which are run through FormAssembly. Any feedback on the site's structure would be really, really appreciated! Web design's a lot of fun, and I'd loooove to get better at it. Thanks!",

The menu in the left seems to be in a bunch of different font sizes, that's confusing, it doesn't flow at all.\n2. The purple background when you hover over each menu item doesn't match the remaining color scheme in the website, you can improve this and make it match your orange.\n3. The static site doesn't resize well on mobile devices at all but this is something you can fix later.\n4. On the front page, [this graphic](http://www.rgft.net/robin/diagram.png) should be improved. It's too confusing and the handwriting is hard to understand.\n5. This [animated graphic](http://www.rgft.net/things/nboard/coolkids.gif) is too flashy, perhaps slow down the gif so it changes less often, or have the ability to alternate between different images with left/right buttons, this is something that can be improved with jQuery.\n6. The amazon link on the left panel should have bigger font, but perhaps with less text. Hovering over it is too flashy in my opinion, going from orange to white and swapping foreground/background colors is excessive imho.\n7. Your buttons (Click here) and (Make easy money with noteboards) have a color that doesn't really match the site, and have a [button background](http://www.rgft.net/butt.png) which should not exist, you can do this with CSS (rounded corners), make it simpler and better center the text.\n8. In your about me menu page, you have links for Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, and another one of your websites. You could instead just have the logos of each of the sites below your menu. It's slightly better and cuts down the number of things on your menu.\n9. The spacing for your menu is very small, it makes it difficult to click on one specific menu item, I would increase the height of each item at least slightly to increase the area the user has to click one item because it increases the possibility that they will click the right thing significantly.\n10. Also, the orange with black background (general color scheme) doesn't flow too well. I would first rework the image of noteboards. Once you rework your image, redesigining the site may be better. I notice you somewhat use the lightbulb as the logo, but its still confusing since I think the lightbulb is the image for RGBT, and noteboards are just a part of RGBT, but since there isn't much else other than Noteboards on the site, the line between RGBT and Noteboards is relatively confusing.\n\nI hope this helps / gets you started on improving the site :).\n\nEDIT: added point 10.",

A lot of times, this isn't possible, but it's really useful for background images when it is appropriate for them to appear \"out of focus\".\n2) There are tools that allow you to compress certain regions of a JPG more than others. For example, you can compress the solid color background of a portrait, but leave the hair any eyes uncompressed. This gives the image a sharp look, without requiring such a large file size.",

I have a good knowledge of HTML, CSS and some basic programming (in C and Python). Now, what else do I need to learn in order to make some money doing jobs online? I am aware that there are many paths to that, but I'm currently interested in the quickest one. PHP? Making WordPress templates? Establishing hundreds of spammy websites with affiliate marketing / ads? Something totally unrelated?\n\nI tried doing some small gigs on a freelancing site a year and a half ago (turning PSD files to HTML/CSS pages), but it was pretty much impossible to get the requesters to pick you, so I gave up on that. But that was more like turning a hobby into something profitable, and now I really need the money.\n\nThanks.",

Javascript is the language that is embedded on webpages and that (generally) is used to manipulate elements or content on a page. It's somewhat easy to learn even if you don't have a programming background. Java on the other hand is an object oriented programming language which in my opionon is a lot harder to maste than javascript. If you are searching for java tutorials you might get confused. Usually newbies like yourself call javascript java so learn the difference early on. I would first suggest you start with HTML , master the basic stucture of a page , learn how to place content and its tags, then go to links and images. Learn about semantic markup and make a habit of validating your code. From that point you can then go to javascript and then to php. \n\nHope it helps.",

            "description": "Ok, maybe I've had a little too much red bull this morning, but this has been bubbling about in my brain for months.\n\n**Design is the science of communication.** As a designer, it is your job to interpret a brief and conceptualize the best way to communicate the message to your audience. This is true whether you design for print, web, or make baseball caps for special schools. I feel that this fundamental approach has been completely ignored by 99% of *professional* web designers, and in turn, sacrificed for flashy interactions and design trends that serve no purpose.  \n  \n\"But wait!\" I hear you say, \"That floral footer for my design blog I spent three days making looks really cool and strengthens the branding of my site. Plus it has a really cool parallax scrolling thing when you resize the window. It's awesome!\". No it isn't. Sure, it's pretty and trendy, and  some of your users might think - \"Wow, thats cool\", but consider it's actual importance. What purpose does it serve? It doesn't strengthen your branding, because there are a million other sites out there that have a floral footer. Does it help convey the information contained in the footer? It might do in some small way, but if you think about it objectively it doesn't take much head scratching to realize that there are much better ways to represent that information. If you're building a website for a florist, who want to create a beautiful and dainty atmosphere for the brand, then maybe a floral footer is a good choice, but for fuck sake don't plaster your design agency's website with tacky deviant art flower silhouettes - what's does it actually achieve? \n  \n\"What about that rotating slideshow on my portfolio page? I'm using this sweet jQuery plugin to create a 3D effect.\" Why are you using it? Because it looks cool, or because it was the most contextually appropriate way of displaying that information? Interactive animated content is my speciality, so I'm not one to shy away from said techniques, but there has to be a reason behind it. For example, the client has sent through a five page .doc with their 'about' information, the only problem is that it has to fit in a 450 x 300 block on one page. This would be the perfect opportunity to add a layer of interaction that allows the user to browse the content in a meaningful way. Each slide elaborates on the previous one, allowing the user to gain as much understanding as they need. It's not there because it's a \"sweet effect that everyone's doing\", it's there because it's a *solution to communication problem*.   \n  \nI used to read design blogs such as smashing magazine, noupe, etc etc, but every single 'Top 100 RSS buttons' article made me shudder. You can't just pick and choose a cool style randomly to use for an element on a page, even if it fits thematically with the rest of your design. Each element should be considered. Why do your buttons have gradient backgrounds? Is it because it's a design trend, or is it because you want to draw attention from the other elements of your site that use block colour backgrounds? Why do you have a drop down menu? Is it because it's a cool example of a l33t bit of javascript you found that fades the menus nicely, or is it because it's the best way to represent your site structure? All these questions seemed to be ignored by a majority of the web design community.  \n  \nI don't want this to be a Nielson style rant, I'm not against visual flair by any means, my issues stem from the lack of consideration by most web designers. Too many designers rely on 'design trends' to shape the branding of their projects, without considering the implications. By relying on design trends you're ignoring the most important skill of being a designer, the conceptual process. A good designer doesn't scour the design blogs for inspiration before starting a project, a good designer outlines the goals of the project, the tone of the message being communicated and then considers the best way to realize their findings.\n  \nThe upside of all this lack of consideration, is that amateurs now have tools where they can create \"professional grade\" sites with relative ease. The internet is the repository of all (most?) human knowledge and as web designers it is our job to display that information in the best way possible. At the moment, we're failing. I'm failing, you're failing, we're all failing. A designer is an artist, a scientist, a psychologist, an historian, an archivist and many more roles wrapped up into one bundle. We should start fucking acting like it.\n  \nSo...err...discuss?\n  \n**tl;dr:** There is not enough consideration in web design. There should be reason behind the style and placement of every element. Design trends are subjective, step away from trends and spend more time thinking about the project objectively.\n\n**EDIT:** Ok, when I posted this I was having a shitty morning, so it does come off a little aggressive and arrogant. For that I am sorry, but I do still stand by points. To clarify, I feel that I am just as guilty as the next person, and I'm trying to change the way I approach web design. This wasn't meant as a \"everyone else sucks, I'm great\" rant, rather a talking point about the creative process.",

Glad to say we were able to help him, and then build a company out of the process. \n\nBut I will say that for solo web designers, etc, it's hard to execute across all fronts, particularly when a user doesn't really understand brand, or thinks 'website IS brand' - then everyone's set up to fail. Building a brand is a big enough process in itself, and uninformed clients often expect web designers to build them a brand.

            "description": "Hear me out. I've got over a decade of experience since finishing college for web design and development. Html and CSS are child's play obviously at this point, and with JavaScript and PHP I can accomplish whatever is needed with little concern about running into time consuming problems. I've done web design/development and site management for a few companies over the years using various CMS (usually WordPress). I have college + certs + trainings.  (Edit: Just to clarify I have taken several full stack boot camps over the years as well, but have only a tiny amount paid full stack experience. I've found that learning how to make full stack web applications was amazing for my understanding of dynamic content etc but never paid off beyond giving me best practices that made me better at my hobby of game development.) \n\nAs someone with this level of knowledge and experience, I can tell you that I do not personally have any confidence that this job is still a real job or career.\n\nI do not feel that my skillset has much value in 2024, and I feel that it will have pretty much null value by 2030. \n\n I see people on Reddit offering this strange toxic positive advice to people looking to get into this. They act like there is work. 10 years ago before Squarespace and Wix had grown to their current level of awareness, small biz still bought websites. Fast forward to today, the ratio of small biz that will buy a site vs have their lowest paid staff make a shitty one with Squarespace is pretty sad. And of course, AI will make the small biz DIY problem even worse.  \n\nIn addition to that, agencies also haven't changed their ways in the last decade, simply offering mass produced garbage with zero interest in high quality or high performance. Now with modern automation tools their entire model can be replaced with a single sales person who knows how to use a tool to generate site samples and quick cheap sites when purchased. \n\nAs for tech... well if you don't have a cs degree and practice leetcode all day in your mom's basement you're probably not getting past the gatekeeper on this one.\n\nSo I sincerely am curious if anyone is getting the impression that this is still a real job, or that this job will actually exist in a decade. Why? How? \n\nFor those of you who agree that this ship was already sinking and is now springing more leaks by the year, where are you heading next?\n\nEdit: Just to be more clear on the question, I mean any job/career that falls under the title of web designer, or web developer. I mean anything from true custom front end development to churning out page builder sites. I think the entire spectrum of skillsets is in deep trouble, not just \"real\" devs or \"fake\" devs. In the eyes of the majority of laypeople and smb decision makers, it's all the same to them.\n\nI'm not saying YOU are going to lose your job. I'm saying someone else is, and then people who come after them will have a harder and harder time entering until a more accurate balance supply/demand for these skills is reached, at which point I believe it will be a much smaller, much less appealing industry.",

Clients change vendors based on just one thing: price. \n\nIf there's a human or software that will do your job for cheaper, they will just take it.\n\nYou must begin to empower yourself and to do so your approach must change.\n\nIf you approach your work as partner/consultant providing a path to success for a business, you are far more difficult to replace. For this your skills have to grow outside of the technicals and into marketing/soft skills.\n\nLearn branding, marketing, and get better at your pitches. Listen better, think of yourself as a traveling doctor, helping businesses wherever you can. Stop selling yourself short. Stop dreading the \"future of no-code\" websites. \n\nI think careers as a web designer will rapidly change into more of a product design role at the very top.  \nBut there's still going to be PLENTY of business.\n\n5 million businesses open up every single year. You may not get the biggest pieces of the pie but the crumbs are worth millions. The web designer who transitions into a product consultant, gets a business coach, grows their network, and learns to bring eyeballs to a business???? That kind of high value work will ALWAYS be in demand.\n\nTake it from a 36 year old schmuck who went from $100 themeforest bullshit sites to six figures with no degree.  \nI can tell you right now, I am NOT anywhere near as talented as the vast majority of the incredible work I see on here. Clients don't give a shit what you build on, they don't give a shit how full stack you are. They just care if it works. Great design should be invisible anyway. Most people simply will not see it. It's the way it is.\n\nThat's not to say it isn't important, it is but it's one part of many.\n\nIf you're afraid of being replaced in this coming wave, ask yourself the following:\n\n* Can you explain *why* your work matters to a business's success?\n* Do you know how to identify a business's real pain points, beyond just \"they need a website\"?\n* Can you create a narrative around your work that connects it to measurable outcomes (like more leads, sales, or brand authority)?\n* Are you building websites that actively solve problems, or are they just digital business cards?\n* Can you position yourself as an expert who offers solutions, not just a designer who follows instructions?\n* Do you understand the *business* behind the design—what drives your client’s growth and bottom line?\n\n20 years from now will be the same as 20 years ago, fundamentals will not change.   \nKeep your heads up though, you are uniquely positioned to succeed because you've all taken the first step that paralyzes everyone else. You've talked to clients. You've sold your sites. You've honed your skills.\n\nChange your mindset and you'll ride this new wave. You are needed!",

The Webinterface is written in php, but there isn't any API or php Sourcecode available. Now i ran into following problem, the index.php generates a frameset containing two frames, one navigation frame and the other one called \"output\" displays the main content. Since Chrome Plugins are written in HTML, CSS and JS it is easy to set a direct link to the \"output\" frame-content, so i could link for example to \"mail.php\" or \"foobar.php\". Is it somehow possible to load specific content into the \"output\" frame via <a href> command?\n\nThanks for help, mrw1llowfield. ",

Paste screenshot into Photoshop.\n4. Trace the boxes, gradients, fonts, *everything*.\n5. Repeat.\n\nAfter a while, you'll be able to pick up on design trends as well as analyze them and make them **even better**.  The next thing you know, you'll be able to chime in when some designer out there claims that you can colorize a black and white photo by setting the layer's blending style to, \"Screen\" and painting beneath it with the Rubber Stamp tool.  You'll be able to look at a business card and muse about rounding the corners.  You'll look, talk and even *think* like a designer.\n\n... the world will never know the Truth.\n\nAlright... dammit.

Text should always have high contrast with the background, and should never overlay a picture. You can fade a picture out, or make it an extremely light texture and then put text on it, but not otherwise.\n\n2. Set a color scheme and decide on a \"feel\" before you begin designing.

Learn it, do NOT rely on tools like Dreamweaver/Kompozer/etc, they are NOT meant for serious work and you will do much better with a local web server and a text editor.\n\nAs for where you learn HTML and the basics of CSS, go to w3schools, that's where I learned years ago and the resources there are nothing short of excellent.\n\nAs for the javascript part, I'd have to question if you really need to learn javascript, for my work jQuery has suited my needs 99% of the time and it hides away a lot of the nastiness of the DOM (among other things).  You might still want to read up on the basics like string/array manipulation though.\n\nGetting started with building sites, that's a toughie.  It depends, really, you said you barely know HTML so it would be best if you started with static sites.  If you want to get some features you normally get from dynamic sites like templates, etc then you could try a static site generator like [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (I'm using this for my new portfolio site).\n\nWhen it comes to backend languages, you're talking about development stuff, not design.  Don't get pulled into the mix of 12 year old php coders who think design and development are the same thing, they're not.  But if you want to actually do both then I'd suggest picking up a web framework like Merb(My personal favorite)/Rails/Django, there's thousands of others but those are the most comprehensive and will get you started a lot faster.  Little advice though, if you start learning a web framework DO NOT only learn the parts of the language that are used in the framework, I do not care if you only do Rails work that does NOT excuse you from being clueless about the standard library.\n\nEDIT: If you chose to go the ruby route feel free to join us in /r/ruby and #ruby/#ruby-lang on freenode :)",

All from COLD leads. and Ive started on my own and then expanded to a team of 5 people , and never really wanted to go beyond that. I was happy with my \"sweet spot\" making a good  income and savings.\n\nNow, I am shifting away from web design into more own projects, and slowly winding down my existing clients and phaseing them out, and no longer prospecting or taking new clients.\n\nBUT I feel like other smaller web agencies and freelancers, could use my way of getting leads.  so I thought maybe I can use my lead gen method and build a business out of it ( IF THERE IS INTEREST.. that's why I am here)\n\nso my question is : if you are a web designer,  would having a daily list of MANUALLY vetted COLD leads with the owners contact info be of interest?\n\nThese will be businesses with websites that clearly have issues on them, bad design, broken code, or other \"do you help on that\" type of lead.\n\nwould you pay for such a service. and how much do you think a fair cost per lead would be?",

If they were vetted to my specifications, as opposed to a broader generalized vetting, absolutely I’d be interested.\n\nI once did cold calls for a “content marketing” company. The company handled content updates for large clients such as Mercedes, but decided to try extending their business model to small businesses. The marketing team would “vet” prospective clients, but only in the sense that they’d confirm contact information and the existence of a website that needs a lot of help. Timmy’s Lemonade Stand in Nebraska obviously has no interest in drumming up business with an SEO optimized website.\n\nI’m not a good salesperson. If Timmy asked how paying for our service would bring in revenue, particularly enough to justify the cost, the simple fact was it absolutely would not. I have no interest in bullshitting small business owners into a contract. I like helping people, and web design is a great way to help people who don’t have the know-how or capacity to do it themselves.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Does your vetting process include criteria that would indicate that a business may need or be interested in a new website? I like your idea and it’d definitely fill a need, but for me it’d depend on what your vetting process  examines.",

First of all, development and design jobs are highly geospatially clustered around major metro areas...more so in tech hubs like San Fran, NYC, Seattle, Denver/Boulder, and Austin. (I should know, I work as a full time web dev, started multiple startups, and did locational analysis in college). I work in NYC and I can rattle a dozen companies off the top of my head (mine included) that are looking for full-time or part-time/contract web designers and literally can't find anyone. Rates are heading north of $400 per hour or $95,000 a year for full-time.\n\nSecond, aside from the increased rates/salary (and vastly increased cost of living... won't lie to you there), there are infinitely more interesting opportunities in places like SF, NYC, Austin, etc. \n\nThird, there's nothing like having a large community of fellow designers/devs around to help you grow and learn, share contacts, leads, etc. It seems nice to be a big fish in a small pond, but the big fish dies when the pond dries up (rough analogy I know...just go with it).\n\n",

Study Facebook, Google, Twitter design methodologies, they regularly release info on their processes, give away toolsets, etc. Can't get a $95k/yr big city job coasting off PHP copy/paste skills. \n\nIf no one wants to pay you then work for yourself. Plan out 30 or 60 days and work on your own projects, bill yourself the hours. Crank out some well-designed single-page apps--even if it's just a todo list or to tell the weather. Spend some weekend time and contribute to open source projects, read up on tech writing and write documentation, release more jQuery plugins, etc. \n\nYour location is not essential. Remember this, your physical location is not essential. There are plenty of companies out there eager for talent and willing to accomodate telecommute. But you have to sell yourself first before you can negotiate that option.\n\nCreate a business network locally then expand. Make an effort to travel to Dallas once a month for their meetups. Better yet, start a local interest group. Even if you're living out in Bumfuck Egypt you can do something creative. Organize a Saturday morning breakfast for local business owners and TEACH them about social media best practices or discuss tech events. Make it appealing for them and explain why it's relevant and they'll be grateful. Gather grandparents at a church and help them setup basic webpages to show off photos.\n\nNow you're known as the web guy around town, people will slowly start to refer work to you. Even if the majority of those leads are crap at least you're getting work flow. You get used to this for awhile and then get to the next level. Then the next. Then the next.

For example, if you're using some JS to add some flair to your menus, you still shouldn't make your menus rely on JS. This is, I think, just a general best practice, and one consequence of it is that also users with JS fully turned off for whatever can navigate your site (but also things like maintainability, code structure etc. will benefit).\n\ntl;dr: either go all-in or support everyone.",

If you wanna make more than $100k doing this you need to delegate responsibilities to other people to do work for you faster and better than you can, and reuse as much as you can so you aren’t reinventing the wheel on every project. \n\nI have two packages:\n\nI have lump sum $3800 minimum for 5 pages and $25 a month hosting and general maintenance \n\nor $0 down $175 a month, unlimited edits, 24/7 support, hosting, etc. \n\n$100 one time fee per page after 5, blog integration $250 for a custom blog that you can edit yourself. \n\nLump sum can add on the unlimited edits and support for $50 a month + hosting, so $75 a month for hosting and unlimited edits.  \n\n7/10 opt for subscription. This is majority of my income at nearly $14k a month right now. You should look into subscriptions and retainer fees. It’s the best way to have reliable income that can grow over time. There’s no reason you should only be making $50k a year doing this. You should be making more. But if you have to keep working the same hours and projects every year to make that $50k, then you’re running into a bottleneck of productivity. You need to scale and reduce development time. \n\nI’m one that uses templates for my subscription sites. Templates get a bad name because they’re all crap from themeforest and the others. So instead I made a Library of my own templates that I paid my designers to make and hand coded. Theres only so many ways to make standard web design structures likes cards, image/content side by sides, hero’s, etc. they all have the same base skeletons just tweaked for different designs and needs. By creating this library and pre building all my templates in my own hand code I can build sites faster. My designers take the design file for each template to make a new complete home page and customize them to the client and add new things them. Design takes much less time, and development is just copy and pasting the templates they’re based off of and customizing them to match the design. It’s all still high quality custom code, just premade ahead of time. \n\nThat’s how I can work more projects at the same time. I have two designers working on multiple projects and 6 developers building them. I have 16 open projects right now. Can’t do that on my own. I have the perfect assembly line for static informational sites that look awesome, load fast, and actually convert and rank better than their previous sites. Doesn’t matter that they’re templates. What matters is the person using them and the quality of them. \n\nBuilding sites with ai is still crap. Very lazy and pumps out low quality work. If you wanna make more money you need to build a team and streamline your workflow. Once I did that my income exploded. I’m going for $300k in 2025. ai doesn’t take away from your value. It adds to it because it’s so shit it makes your work more attractive by comparison. People hate ai things. There’s always a market for the human touch.",

                    "comment": "I am a web developer and I do all of my work on Linux.\n\nI'll cover the general operating environment first. I use KDE, and I love a lot of the tools that it puts at my finger tips. Not only is it a rock-solid platform, but it uses desktop effects to actually improve my productivity, and the Plasma widgets give me the flexibility to truly own my desktop. The seamless integration of FTP and SFTP with KIO is pretty amazing, and lets me access files on a remote server from all my main applications such as the Dolphin file manager, Kate and KDevelop IDEs, and even more random programs like the Gwenview image viewer.\n\nAs for setting up a server, it is incredibly easy. I use Apache 2, PHP 5, MySQL, PHP MyAdmin, and the Userdir mod. This allows me to develop out of a \"public_html\" folder in my home directory. This is very efficient, and great for testing and editing. The fact that I can throw together a server in about 15 minutes after the install completes is just wonderful.\n\nBrowser testing? Chrome, ReKonq, the Phone View Widget, Opera, Firefox, Amaya, Dillo, and Lynx should provide a more than adequate sampling, with the sole exception of Internet Explorer. I run a Windows 7 virtual machine to test websites in IE, and thankfully Virtual Box is a truly first-class virtual machine manager.\n\nNow, Photoshop! To be honest, I don't see what the big deal is. Yes, Photoshop has a lot of great features, and yes, it has some that I really wish GIMP did have and does not. That said, the single biggest feature that Photoshop has over GIMP is single window mode, which it doesn't actually have on Mac OS. GIMP, on the other hand, has had Smart Remove Selection for many years now, and provides some functions like fractal-based upscaling that Photoshop is noticeably lacking in and requires special and often expensive plugins. Quite simply, for the things I actually *need* out of a photo editor, GIMP is always there for me, and works incredibly well. With Single Window Mode and hardware accelerated filters being introduced in the next version, GIMP just keeps getting better. (Thanks AMD, btw, for the hardware accelerated filters!) Now, there are some things that Photoshop can do that I do sometimes need that GIMP does not. Photo stitching, painting, and HDR are three of those things. Luckily, Hugin, MyPaint, and Luminance HDR each fill their particular niche, and as dedicated tools they respectively kick Photoshop's overpriced rear.\n\nSo what about the rest of the suite? Illustrator is the singe app in the suite that I actually actively avoid. I hate it. I find it clunky, heavy, and I find it hard to find the features I want (particularly path cutting and boolean tools) at my fingertips. In my opinion, Inkscape is simply a superior tool. Inkscape has an incredible display engine, and makes all the tools I really want to get work done readily available without having to dig through menus, and goes a step further with features like image tracing, cloning, and PDF import that are just downright useful, and better implemented than they are in Illustrator.\n\nNow, InDesign is a great software, it really is. That said, Scribus does a simply fantastic job of being comparable. Here, I don't even need to get into a feature-for-feature comparison. The latest version of Scribus is currently in release candidate 6, and adds what few features were lacking. Simply put, if InDesign can do it, so can Scribus.\n\nArdour kicks Adobe Audition to the curb, no questions asked. It can out perform it in every way. Period.\n\nUnfortunately, the one software that is the crown jewel of the Adobe suite, I truly miss. Adobe Premiere was my first love for video editing, and to this day, I wish very much that it had a Linux version. I own a Windows software, Sony Vegas, that I am very fond of, and I have excitedly watched Kdenlive mature on the open source front, but neither can compare to Premiere.\n\nThe Adobe Suite is a good collection of software, but not worth anywhere near close to the price for which it is sold. Open Source software today can very much hold its own, and when it comes to web development, Linux has everything you need.\n\nOh, I didn't talk about Dreamweaver. Linux has Kompozer, I suppose, but really I advise strongly against using such an editor, which is why I didn't really mention it.\n\nGood Luck! I think you'll find Linux to be a wonderful and rewarding web development environment. KUbuntu is the distro I would recommend, but virtually any distro will have all the tools I mentioned. ",

Basically we provide a timeline for all of the projects to clients (timeline for the initial site build, design, dev, etc. and a timeline for updates and maintenance).  The clients have due dates, just like we have.\n\nIf the client fails to deliver on time, that's generally ok, as also built into the contract is the warning that every single day of delay they cause, the delivery timeline moves back three days (we have a production schedule to keep, and if we need to shuffle their project it isn't quite a 1:1 ratio.)\n\nIf the client falls 30 days behind a timeline (and doesn't really respond when we begin to warn them about it) contractually, the project is put \"on hold\" - we keep the original deposit (generally 50%) and if they'd like us to pick the project back up, there is a fee to get started again.  This fee varies and is meant to act more as a deterrent than an actual source of revenue, but you can't be lenient about it.  If you waive it (unless under special circumstances) they'll realize it is something they can push over on you, and you'll be back in the same spot.\n\nHope this helps!",

If you're good, you could make money on 99designs doing logos, business cards, etc; and while 99d isn't exactly the greatest business model for freelancers, you could still make some money. There are also a ton of agencies looking for graphic designers to design for print and the web.\n\nSo, as for where I would start:\n\n* You **need** an online portfolio. You won't get many offers without one. Use your portfolio as a playground to learn web design and front-end development.\n* If you're good with the graphic design aspect but not so much the coding side, check out /r/webdev and try to partner up with someone. Maybe you could build WordPress themes together to sell on Themeforest or something.\n* Get on Twitter and start interacting with people in the graphic design community... get your name **and your work** out there.\n* If you're really interested in the development side of things, CSS-Tricks.com is a good place to start. \n* Lastly, just build stuff. Whether it's your portfolio or a blog for your dog... Challenge yourself to do new things on each site you develop and **just build stuff**.\n\nDon't let \"oh well school didn't teach me\" stand in the way of actually getting out there. A **very** high percentage of people working in web design and development have no \"formal\" training.",

That is, if you can be bothered with creating your sites twice - once, painstakingly, with a graphics program, and then again, in actual code.\n\nI've found out that, contrary to what many claim, designing in the browser can work out great (here's an [attempt](http://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/15l4kh/care_to_have_a_look_at_my_first_html_theme/) of mine, I dare say it turned out quite fine). So learn to code in HTML and CSS - and getting yourself a good editor for that is paramount (I use Sublime Text).\n\nThat said, I must admit real-world Web design is still a mystery to me. I'm just someone who likes creating stuff with computers and hoping that'll earn some money some day. Where I live, you can probably make it OK with $200 per month anyway, so your situation is probably quite different from mine.\n\nThat leads me to a completely wild suggestion - pack your bags and move to somewhere where living is cheap (Eastern Europe comes to mind), and work online. Starting a design agency and bringing Web design there into the 21st century would be a breeze. Seriously, there's a lot of people earning a living here with work that'd be mediocre in 1997.\n\nWTF did I write. Whatever, must be the pills.",

The problem is that cutting the time spent on each project in order to take them all on risks cutting the very quality that brought them to you. A good way of dealing with that is for management to raise rates (cuts out low profit clients) and to have the balls to tell prospects that \"we can't fit you in now but lets talk again in two months.\"\n\n[Andy Rutledge](http://www.andyrutledge.com/), [Paul Boag](http://boagworld.com/), and [Mike Monteiro](http://weblog.muledesign.com/) have all written on different aspects of the project management and the design process.\n\nI came across [this series of posts](http://ahhacreative.com/2011/11/14/working-with-clients-part-5/) some time back and it might give you some good things to think about. \n\nBeing at a small agency, books for freelancers like [this](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/professional-workflow-1.html) or [this](http://www.amazon.com/Successful-Freelancing-Web-Designers-Smashing/dp/1119992737/) might be helpful. I've only read the second book and it didn't have much that I hadn't already learned from experience or from others (see the names above) but if I had found it earlier in my education I can see how it would have been useful.\n\n[Getting Real](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php) by 37signals is written from the perspective of an app developer and may provide an alternative perspective. \n\n**Edit :** The archives over at [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/) are full of great stuff and their [books](http://www.abookapart.com/) are very well done.

Using them for other means actually creates some accessibility issues (namely, screen readers have problems with table layouts, and search engine crawlers don't index as well)\n* HTML is not meant to convey layout information.  This is what CSS is meant for, and layout tables break that relationship.  This affects maintainability (it's much easier to make site-wide adjustments in CSS than to fix every table layout).  Further, it's more difficult to create alternate stylesheets (which is an accessibility issue -- think high-contrast/enlarged print stylesheets; also consider stylesheets for mobile browsers).\n\n**Edited** for clarity.",

The best thing you can do is to settle on the one that you hate the least.\nI've tried about every single editor that can run on linux, and a bunch of the ones that you can run on windows. They are all shit. I hate them all.\n\nThe problem is, that they all have an awesome and fundamentally useful feature that none of the others have. So, the inverse is also true: every single one of them lacks a feature that you really, really need to use. \nFuck them all. They all suck.\n\nThere's a feature that is fundamentally useful for everyday work with html/xhtml : being able to create a selection from a tag pair. The only editor that can do that, that I know of is quanta - an old, decrepit, editor that fell behind on other features years ago because it has so few developers.\n\nAptana is horribly over-complicated. So many features, that the most basic ones are totally obscured. A horribly steep learning curve. Heavy on system resources. I mean, fuck - why should it take so long to figure out how import existing files into a new project? Why does it have the potential to blow away all of your files when you remove a project? \n\nNetbeans gets great reviews and much praise - but it looks pig ugly. All the fonts are jagged and spiky and the colours are gross. Again, it takes ages to figure out the very basics. It's 'emacs keybindings' don't work. Navigating around the file is a pain. You can't create selections from the navigator window, which would seem like an obvious and convenient way to edit complex html.You can't create selects from tag-pairs. Oh, and it's a complete resource hog.\n\nKompozer and bluefish are childs toys, that you can't really get anything done with.\n\nEmacs is a complete frankenstein, made of bolted together bits of eye-boggling code. Trying to modify into an ide takes days and can't be gauranteed to work. If you want to do have any real IDE functionality in it, or any extensions other then the most basic, and you have to learn a whole new fucking programming language. It's a dinosaur. Code navigation sucks. It lacks some pretty basic features, like code-folding. There is nothing like real project management. Maybe cedet, but like everything in emacs, it takes ages to setup, is horribly complicated, and doesn't really work properly.\n\nNone of these editors can handle mixed html and php (indentation, code colouring, debugging) , so working with wordpress is a pain in the backside. Netbeans may be an exception to this - I'm testing it right now with the default wordpress themes. I'm kind of I'll find a horrible weakness with netbeans and mixed html/php, because I don't want to have to use yet another editor for the same file.\n\njackpn : the code completion features you are talking about should be installed or easy to install in any editor. Emacs, vi, eclipse all have templates and zen-coding extensions.\n\n",

He's really energetic and has a lot of ideas, but most of them are out of touch with reality and this refusal to cooperate is just the last straw. Now I just feel like dropping him.\n\nHas anyone else ever been in this kind of situation?\n\n---\n\nA client has about 200 photos to incorporate in the 25 page site about his business (I talked him down from 500 photos in 64 pages). I finally tire of phone calls and decide to let him have it his way. Worst case scenario, he pays me. Best case scenario, I swoop in 6 months later and get paid for an SEO overhaul.\n\nI give explicit instructions multiple times over the phone, on Skype videochat, and in emails. All he has to do is send me a folder of the JPEGs (in personal meetings, I've seen that he has exactly what I want in one folder) and fill in an Excel spreadsheet that I've provided with the title/descriptions he wrote (so the db import can be automated). That's all he has to do. That's it. I even include a screenshot of a OSX Finder window with the correct folder structure and dummy pictures, and I populate 3 examples in the spreadsheet next to my instructions.\n\nHe gives indication over the phone and in emails that he's hard at work for 2 weeks. He's pretty handy with his iPhone/iLife products and I've seen him use his MacBook Pro enough to think that he understands how to properly use computers. I think he even knows how to internet.\n\nThen I get an email-- I should have known something was wrong when a 700+ MB .pages file was the only thing in it. He actually dragged n'dropped nearly 200 photos into an Apple Pages file, then arranged and resized them so that he could type around them.\n\nI calmly and professionally explain why I can't use this at all-- not the photos and not the text-- and ask him to please follow the methods he agreed to.\n\nSo the next day he sends me a Pages file with the descriptions (they're all in different fonts/sizes/colors) but no photos. I calmly and professionally explain that he needs to do as he agreed to.\n\nThe next day (today), I actually get the proper spreadsheet. There are a lot of typos, but I don't have the heart to tell him yet. I just finished downloading the 680 MB zip file of \"final website photos\" to find.... it's useless OSX Finder \".pictClipping\" files.\n\nI re-sent my instructions and calmly explained why he needs to send me JPEGs, but I don't have high expectations.\n\nI know how to make websites herp all that way to the derpery, I've learned how to deal with IE... I can even tolerate my graphic designer. But hey, Seasoned Vets, **how the hell do you deal with these kind of clients???**",

And I fucked up a *lot* of contracts and burned a lot of bridges as a result of that attitude. If I approach a client with humility, I feel that the contract goes a hell of a lot smoother.\n\nI'm not trying to rip you to shreds and tell you that your attitude sucks, but the fact is that it sounds like you're making the client jump through unreasonable hoops. If a client says they're hard at work on something for you (and for two weeks), you're definitely doing something wrong. It may mean that you need to go through some hand-holding with the client and it might feel like it's wasting your time, but look at how much time, energy, and effort you've already wasted trying to get him to do it your way? In addition, it sounds like your client sent you all of the raw data you needed to populate the database at the very start. Sure, it wasn't in the format you wanted it in, but what would've stopped you from doing the formatting for him?",

With these smaller sites it's pretty easy to spec out exactly what you will provide, page by page. Add in a clause detailing your hourly rate, and that you're willing to go outside of the contract at the hourly rate. I've doubled some contracts for a fraction of the work due to extra hourly billing. Always inform the client of however many extra hours they have run up to avoid unpleasant \"I won't pay that\" conversations.",

Providing them a document just makes it seem more legit, and gives them a good feeling of what exactly they are spending money on. ie: why your skills are worth $500.\n\nFor yourself: Break down each project you work on into smaller tasks that you can assign a time value to.  Make a guesstimate of how long you think it will take, and when your done also record how long it actually took.  After a few projects you'll know very clearly if you are over or under charging for your services.\n\nYou might want to look into some online billing services to help keep track of who owes what when. One of the things I did when charging monthly fees was put everyone on the same schedule.  Pro-rate the first month so everyone gets charged on the first.  Just made everything more clear for myself when it came time to charge.\n\n\n",

            "description": "It is omnipresent!\n\n**First** of all, the peer-review process is *broken*. Every fourth NeurIPS submission is put on arXiv. There are DeepMind researchers publicly going after reviewers who are criticizing their ICLR submission. On top of that, papers by well-known institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection. In contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the AC. (I don't want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this year's ICRL).\n\n**Secondly,** there is a *reproducibility crisis*. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current state-of-the-art method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isn't any.\n\n**Thirdly,** there is a *worshiping* problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. At every ICML conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every DeepMind poster, regardless of the content of the work. The same story happened with the Zoom meetings at the virtual ICLR 2020. Moreover, NeurIPS 2020 had twice as many submissions as ICML, even though both are top-tier ML conferences. Why? Why is the name \"neural\" praised so much? Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the \"godfathers\" of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult.\n\n**Fourthly**, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. However, the *toxicity* and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity. Getting rid of LeCun and silencing people won't solve any issue.\n\n**Fifthly**, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge *diversity problem*. At our CS faculty, only 30% of undergrads and 15% of the professors are women. Going on parental leave during a PhD or post-doc usually means the end of an academic career. However, this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism.  Reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem.\n\n**Sixthly**, moral and ethics are set *arbitrarily*. The U.S. domestic politics dominate every discussion. At this very moment, thousands of Uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. Adding a \"broader impact\" section at the end of every people will not make this stop. There are huge shitstorms because a researcher wasn't mentioned in an article. Meanwhile, the 1-billion+ people continent of Africa is virtually excluded from any meaningful ML discussion (besides a few Indaba workshops).\n\n**Seventhly**, there is a cut-throat publish-or-perish *mentality*. If you don't publish 5+ NeurIPS/ICML papers per year, you are a looser. Research groups have become so large that the PI does not even know the name of every PhD student anymore. Certain people submit 50+ papers per year to NeurIPS. The sole purpose of writing a paper has become to having one more NeurIPS paper in your CV. Quality is secondary; passing the peer-preview stage has become the primary objective.\n\n**Finally**, discussions have become *disrespectful*. Schmidhuber calls Hinton a thief, Gebru calls LeCun a white supremacist, Anandkumar calls Marcus a sexist, everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved.\n\nAlbert Einstein was opposing the theory of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Einstein's_objections_to_quantum_mechanics). Can we please stop demonizing those who do not share our exact views. We are allowed to disagree without going for the jugular. \n\nThe moment we start silencing people because of their opinion is the moment scientific and societal progress dies. \n\nBest intentions, Yusuf",

Let's say each and every person who is a current member of the ML community boycotts OpenAI. What about the hungry novices/newcomers/anyone curious who have a slight CS background (or less), but have never had the resources previously to utilize models in their applications or workflows? As we can all see with the flood of posts of the \"here's my blahblahblah using ChatGPT\" or \"How do I train LLama on my phone?\" variety to any relevant sub, the novice user group is getting bigger day by day. Will they be aware and caring enough to boycott closed modeling practices? Or will they disregard that for the pursuit of money/notoriety, hoping their application takes off? I think I know the answer.\n\nML technology is reaching the threshold that (and I feel sick making the comparison) crypto did in terms of accessibility a few years back, for better or worse. Meaning there will always be new people wanting to utilize these tools who don't care about training/productionizing a model, just that it works as advertised. Right now, I don't think(?) This group outnumbers researchers/experienced ML engineers, but eventually it will if not already. \n\nI hate to be a downer, but I don't see any other way. I would adore to be proved wrong.",

            "description": "Hello there, r/MachineLearning,\n\nRecently, Reddit has announced some [changes to their API](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/) that may have pretty serious impact on many of it's users.\n\n[You may have already seen quite a few posts like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) across some of the other subreddits that you browse, so we're just going to cut to the chase.\n\n# What's Happening\n\nThird Party Reddit apps (such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun and others) are going to become ludicrously more expensive for it's developers to run, which will in turn either kill the apps, or result in a monthly fee to the users if they choose to use one of those apps to browse. Put simply, each request to Reddit within these mobile apps will cost the developer money. The developers of Apollo [were quoted around $2 million per month](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) for the current rate of usage. The only way for these apps to continue to be viable for the developer is if you (the user) pay a monthly fee, and realistically, this is most likely going to just outright kill them. **Put simply: If you use a third party app to browse Reddit, you will most likely no longer be able to do so, or be charged a monthly fee to keep it viable.**\n\nIn lieu of what's happening, [an open letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) has been released by the broader moderation community. Part of this initiative includes a potential subreddit blackout (meaning, the subreddit will be privatized) on June 12th, lasting 24-48 hours or longer. On one hand, this is great to hopefully make enough of an impact to influence Reddit to change their minds on this. On the other hand, we usually stay out of these blackouts, and we would rather not negatively impact usage of the subreddit.\n\nWe would like to give the community a voice in this. Is this an important enough matter that r/machinelearning should fully support the protest and blackout the subreddit on June 12th? Feel free to leave your thoughts and opinions below. \n\nAlso, please use up/downvotes for this submission to make yourself heard: upvote: r/ML should join the protest, downvote: r/ML should not join the protest.",

Believe it or not, this algorithm already exists as early as iOS 14.3, hidden under obfuscated class names. After some digging and reverse engineering on the hidden APIs I managed to export its model (which is MobileNetV3) to ONNX and rebuild the whole NeuralHash algorithm in Python. You can now try NeuralHash even on Linux!\n\nSource code: [https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX](https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX)\n\nNo pre-exported model file will be provided here for obvious reasons. But it's very easy to export one yourself following the guide I included with the repo above. You don't even need any Apple devices to do it.\n\nEarly tests show that it can tolerate image resizing and compression, but not cropping or rotations.\n\nHope this will help us understand NeuralHash algorithm better and know its potential issues before it's enabled on all iOS devices.\n\nHappy hacking!",

It's just that, take the recent \"An Evolutionary Approach to Dynamic Introduction of Tasks in Large-scale Multitask Learning Systems\" paper. It's 18 pages of talking through this pretty convoluted evolutionary and multitask learning algorithm, it's pretty interesting, solves a bunch of problems. But two notes. \n\nOne, the big number they cite as the success metric is 99.43 on CIFAR-10, against a SotA of 99.40, so woop-de-fucking-doo in the grand scheme of things.\n\nTwo, there's a chart towards the end of the paper that details how many TPU core-hours were used for just the training regimens that results in the final results. The sum total is 17,810 core-hours. Let's assume that for someone who doesn't work at Google, you'd have to use on-demand pricing of $3.22/hr. This means that these trained models cost $57,348. \n\nStrictly speaking, throwing enough compute at a general enough genetic algorithm will eventually produce arbitrarily good performance, so while you can absolutely read this paper and collect interesting ideas about how to use genetic algorithms to accomplish multitask learning by having each new task leverage learned weights from previous tasks by defining modifications to a subset of components of a pre-existing model, there's a meta-textual level on which this paper is just \"Jeff Dean spent enough money to feed a family of four for half a decade to get a 0.03% improvement on CIFAR-10.\"\n\nOpenAI is far and away the worst offender here, but it seems like everyone's doing it. You throw a fuckton of compute and a light ganache of new ideas at an existing problem with existing data and existing benchmarks, and then if your numbers are infinitesimally higher than their numbers, you get to put a lil' sticker on your CV. Why should I trust that your ideas are even any good? I can't check them, I can't apply them to my own projects. \n\nIs this really what we're comfortable with as a community? A handful of corporations and the occasional university waving their dicks at everyone because they've got the compute to burn and we don't?

Rather, it was to explore a setting where one can dynamically introduce new tasks into a running system and successfully get a high quality model for the new task that reuses representations from the existing model and introduces new parameters somewhat sparingly, while avoiding many of the issues that often plague multi-task systems, such as catastrophic forgetting or negative transfer.  The experiments in the paper show that one can introduce tasks dynamically with a stream of 69 distinct tasks from several separate visual task benchmark suites and end up with a multi-task system that can jointly produce high quality solutions for all of these tasks.  The resulting model that is sparsely activated for any given task, and the system introduces fewer and fewer new parameters for new tasks the more tasks that the system has already encountered (see figure 2 in the paper).  The multi-task system introduces just 1.4% new parameters for incremental tasks at the end of this stream of tasks, and each task activates on average 2.3% of the total parameters of the model.  There is considerable sharing of representations across tasks and the evolutionary process helps figure out when that makes sense and when new trainable parameters should be introduced for a new task.\n\nYou can see a couple of videos of the dynamic introduction of tasks and how the system responds here:\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THyc5lUC_-w\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2scExBaHweY\n\nI would also contend that the cost calculations by OP are off and mischaracterize things, given that the experiments were to train a multi-task model that jointly solves 69 tasks, not to train a model for cifar10.  From Table 7, the compute used was a mix of TPUv3 cores and TPUv4 cores, so you can't just sum up the number of core hours, since they have different prices.  Unless you think there's some particular urgency to train the cifar10+68-other-tasks model right now, this sort of research can very easily be done using preemptible instances, which are $0.97/TPUv4 chip/hour and $0.60/TPUv3 chip/hour (not the \"you'd have to use on-demand pricing of $3.22/hour\" cited by OP).  With these assumptions, the public Cloud cost of the computation described in Table 7 in the paper is more like $13,960 (using the preemptible prices for 12861 TPUv4 chip hours and 2474.5 TPUv3 chip hours), or about $202 / task.\n\nI think that having sparsely-activated models is important, and that being able to introduce new tasks dynamically into an existing system that can share representations (when appropriate) and avoid catastrophic forgetting is at least worth exploring.  The system also has the nice property that new tasks can be automatically incorporated into the system without deciding how to do so (that's what the evolutionary search process does), which seems a useful property for a continual learning system.  Others are of course free to disagree that any of this is interesting.\n\nEdit: I should also point out that the code for the paper has been open-sourced at:\n  https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/muNet\n\nWe will be releasing the checkpoint from the experiments described in the paper soon (just waiting on two people to flip approval bits, and process for this was started before the reddit post by OP).",

Put it up on Github they said. I'm all for  open-source, but when a company turns around and charges you for a  product they made with freely and publicly made content, while forbidding you from using the output to create competing models, that is where I  draw the line. It is simply ridiculous. \n\nSam Altman couldn't be anymore predictable with his recent attempts to get the government to start regulating AI.\n\nWhat  risks? The AI is just a messenger for information that is already out  there if one knows how/where to look. You don't need AI to learn how to  hack, to learn how to make weapons, etc. Fake news/propaganda? The  internet has all of that covered. LLMs are no where near the level of AI  you see in sci-fi. I mean, are people really afraid of text? Yes, I  know that text can sometimes be malicious code such as viruses, but  those can be found on github as well.  If they fall for this they might  as well shutdown the internet while they're at it.\n\nHe  is simply blowing things out of proportion and using fear to increase  the likelihood that they do what he wants, hurt the competition. I  bet he is probably teething with bitterness everytime a new huggingface  model comes out. The thought of us peasants being able to use AI  privately is too dangerous. No, instead we must be fed scraps while they  slowly take away our jobs and determine our future.\n\nThis  is not a doomer post, as I am all in favor of the advancement of AI.  However, the real danger here lies in having a company like OpenAI  dictate the future of humanity. I get it, the writing is on the wall;  the cost of human intelligence will go down, but if everyone has their  personal AI then it wouldn't seem so bad or unfair would it? Listen,  something that has the power to render a college degree that costs  thousands of dollars worthless should be available to the public. This  is to offset the damages and job layoffs that will come as a result of  such an entity. It wouldn't be as bitter of a taste as it would if you were replaced by it while still not being able to access it. Everyone should be able to use it as leverage, it is the only fair solution.\n\nIf  we don't take action now, a company like ClosedAI will, and they are  not in favor of the common folk. Sam Altman is so calculated to the  point where there were times when he seemed to be shooting OpenAI in the foot during his talk.  This move is to simply conceal his real intentions, to climb the ladder and take it with him. If he didn't include his company in his  ramblings, he would be easily read. So instead, he pretends to be scared of his own product, in an effort to legitimize his claim. Don't fall  for it.\n\nThey are slowly making a  reputation as one the most hated tech companies, right up there with  Adobe, and they don't show any sign of change. They have no moat,  othewise they wouldn't feel so threatened to the point where they would have to resort to creating barriers of entry via regulation. This only  means one thing, we are slowly catching up. We just need someone to  vouch for humanity's well-being, while acting as an opposing force to the  evil corporations who are only looking out for themselves. Question is,  who would be a good candidate?",

There was an understanding that there was benefit for everyone if research was published openly and in such a way that many organizations could find ways to advance the state of the art. \n\nFrom a game theory perspective it was essentially an iterated prisoners dilemma. The best overall outcome is if every organization cooperates by sharing their research and then everyone can benefit from it. On the other hand, if one organization defects and doesn't share their research with others, this benefits the organization that defected, at the expensive of the organizations that cooperated. This in turn incentivizes other organizations to defect, and we are left with a situation where everyone 'defects', and no one shares their research.\n\nThat is exactly what OpenAI did. They defected in this prisoners dilemma by using so much of the research that was published by others, such as google, to build their product, but then not releasing details needed to replicate GPT4. Now it is reported that going forward [Google will stop sharing their AI research](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/04/google-ai-stop-sharing-research/), indeed choosing to cooperate when the other party will defect would be foolish. \n\nWe had something amazing with the openness and transparency around AI research, and I fear that OpenAI's behavior has seriously undermined that valuable commons.",

            "description": "I recently encountered the PaLM (Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways) paper from Google Research and it opened up a can of worms of ideas I’ve felt I’ve intuitively had for a while, but have been unable to express – and I know I can’t be the only one. Sometimes I wonder what the original pioneers of AI – Turing, Neumann, McCarthy, etc. – would think if they could see the state of AI that we’ve gotten ourselves into. 67 authors, 83 pages, 540B parameters in a model, the internals of which no one can say they comprehend with a straight face, 6144 TPUs in a commercial lab that no one has access to, on a rig that no one can afford, trained on a volume of data that a human couldn’t process in a lifetime, 1 page on ethics with the same ideas that have been rehashed over and over elsewhere with no attempt at a solution – bias, racism, malicious use, etc. – for purposes that who asked for?\n\nWhen I started my career as an AI/ML research engineer 2016, I was most interested in two types of tasks – 1.) those that most humans could do but that would universally be considered tedious and non-scalable. I’m talking image classification, sentiment analysis, even document summarization, etc. 2.) tasks that humans lack the capacity to perform as well as computers for various reasons – forecasting, risk analysis, game playing, and so forth. I still love my career, and I try to only work on projects in these areas, but it’s getting harder and harder.\n\nThis is because, somewhere along the way, it became popular and unquestionably acceptable to push AI into domains that were originally uniquely human, those areas that sit at the top of Maslows’s hierarchy of needs in terms of self-actualization – art, music, writing, singing, programming, and so forth. These areas of endeavor have negative logarithmic ability curves – the vast majority of people cannot do them well at all, about 10% can do them decently, and 1% or less can do them extraordinarily. The little discussed problem with AI-generation is that, without extreme deterrence, we will sacrifice human achievement at the top percentile in the name of lowering the bar for a larger volume of people, until the AI ability range is the norm. This is because relative to humans, AI is cheap, fast, and infinite, to the extent that investments in human achievement will be watered down at the societal, educational, and individual level with each passing year. And unlike AI gameplay which superseded humans decades ago, we won’t be able to just disqualify the machines and continue to play as if they didn’t exist.\n\nAlmost everywhere I go, even this forum, I encounter almost universal deference given to current SOTA AI generation systems like GPT-3, CODEX, DALL-E, etc., with almost no one extending their implications to its logical conclusion, which is long-term convergence to the mean, to mediocrity, in the fields they claim to address or even enhance. If you’re an artist or writer and you’re using DALL-E or GPT-3 to “enhance” your work, or if you’re a programmer saying, “GitHub Co-Pilot makes me a better programmer?”, then how could you possibly know? You’ve disrupted and bypassed your own creative process, which is thoughts -> (optionally words) -> actions -> feedback -> repeat, and instead seeded your canvas with ideas from a machine, the provenance of which you can’t understand, nor can the machine reliably explain. And the more you do this, the more you make your creative processes dependent on said machine, until you must question whether or not you could work at the same level without it.\n\nWhen I was a college student, I often dabbled with weed, LSD, and mushrooms, and for a while, I thought the ideas I was having while under the influence were revolutionary and groundbreaking – that is until took it upon myself to actually start writing down those ideas and then reviewing them while sober, when I realized they weren’t that special at all. What I eventually determined is that, under the influence, it was impossible for me to accurately evaluate the drug-induced ideas I was having because the influencing agent the generates the ideas themselves was disrupting the same frame of reference that is responsible evaluating said ideas. This is the same principle of – if you took a pill and it made you stupider, would even know it? I believe that, especially over the long-term timeframe that crosses generations, there’s significant risk that current AI-generation developments produces a similar effect on humanity, and we mostly won’t even realize it has happened, much like a frog in boiling water. If you have children like I do, how can you be aware of the the current SOTA in these areas, project that 20 to 30 years, and then and tell them with a straight face that it is worth them pursuing their talent in art, writing, or music? How can you be honest and still say that widespread implementation of auto-correction hasn’t made you and others worse and worse at spelling over the years (a task that even I believe most would agree is tedious and worth automating).\n\nFurthermore, I’ve yet to set anyone discuss the train – generate – train - generate feedback loop that long-term application of AI-generation systems imply. The first generations of these models were trained on wide swaths of web data generated by humans, but if these systems are permitted to continually spit out content without restriction or verification, especially to the extent that it reduces or eliminates development and investment in human talent over the long term, then what happens to the 4th or 5th generation of models? Eventually we encounter this situation where the AI is being trained almost exclusively on AI-generated content, and therefore with each generation, it settles more and more into the mean and mediocrity with no way out using current methods. By the time that happens, what will we have lost in terms of the creative capacity of people, and will we be able to get it back?\n\nBy relentlessly pursuing this direction so enthusiastically, I’m convinced that we as AI/ML developers, companies, and nations are past the point of no return, and it mostly comes down the investments in time and money that we’ve made, as well as a prisoner’s dilemma with our competitors. As a society though, this direction we’ve chosen for short-term gains will almost certainly make humanity worse off, mostly for those who are powerless to do anything about it – our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come.\n\nIf you’re an AI researcher or a data scientist like myself, how do you turn things back for yourself when you’ve spent years on years building your career in this direction? You’re likely making near or north of $200k annually TC and have a family to support, and so it’s too late, no matter how you feel about the direction the field has gone. If you’re a company, how do you standby and let your competitors aggressively push their AutoML solutions into more and more markets without putting out your own? Moreover, if you’re a manager or thought leader in this field like Jeff Dean how do you justify to your own boss and your shareholders your team’s billions of dollars in AI investment while simultaneously balancing ethical concerns? You can’t – the only answer is bigger and bigger models, more and more applications, more and more data, and more and more automation, and then automating that even further. If you’re a country like the US, how do responsibly develop AI while your competitors like China single-mindedly push full steam ahead without an iota of ethical concern to replace you in numerous areas in global power dynamics? Once again, failing to compete would be pre-emptively admitting defeat.\n\nEven assuming that none of what I’ve described here happens to such an extent, how are so few people not taking this seriously and discounting this possibility? If everything I’m saying is fear-mongering and non-sense, then I’d be interested in hearing what you think human-AI co-existence looks like in 20 to 30 years and why it isn’t as demoralizing as I’ve made it out to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Day after posting this -- this post took off way more than I expected.

I've learned much more from this discussion with the sub than I could have imagined on this topic, from so many perspectives.

McCarthy was lucky that he lived through the ascendance of his approach in his prime, and saw countless downstream applications of his work and so had much to be proud about even if we increasingly feel a bit embarrassed about that paradigm as a dead end for AI, specifically. He died in 2011, just too early to see the DL eclipse, but still well after 'machine learning' took over, so maybe one could look to see what he wrote about ML to gauge what he thought. I don't know if he would be in denial like some are and claim that it's going to hit a wall or doesn't actually work, pragmatically.\n- Turing and von Neumann would almost certainly be highly enthusiastic: both of them were very interested in neural nets and connectionist and emergent approaches and endorsed the belief that extremely powerful hardware, vast beyond the dreams of researchers in their day in the 1950s, would be required and self-learning approaches would be necessary. Turing might be disappointed that his original projections were a few orders of magnitude off on RAM/FLOPS, but note that it was a reasonable guess in an era where neuroscience was just beginning and computers did literally *nothing* we consider AI (not even the simplest thing like checkers, I think, but I'd have to check the dates) and he was amazingly prescient in predicting that hardware progress would continue exponentially for as long as it has (well before Moore's law was coined); he would point out that we are still lagging far behind the goal of self-teaching/exploring systems which make experiments and explore, substituting in vast amounts of random data and that this must be highly suboptimal. \n- Von Neumann would likewise not be surprised that logical approaches failed to solve many of the most important problems like sensory perception, having early on championed the need for large amounts of computing power (this is what he meant by the remark that people only think logic/math is complex because they don't realize how complex real life is - where logic/math fail, you will need large amounts of computation to go) and building digital computers for solving real-world problems like intractable physics designs. He also made the point in his very last unfinished work all about _The Computer and the Brain_ that because brains are, essentially, Turing-complete, the fact that they can appear to operate by symbolic processes like outputting mathematics, does not entail them operating by symbolic processes or anything even algorithmically equivalent. (I was mostly skimming it for another purpose, so I don't know if he says anything clearly equivalent to Moravec's paradox, but I doubt he would be surprised or disagree.) Finally, he was the first person to use the term 'singularity' in describing the impending end of the human era, replaced by technology. (Yes, that's right. If von Neumann had somehow survived to today, he might well have been a scalingpilled Singularitarian, and highly concerned about China.)",

That may be naivety as I am still very early in my learning and career, but I’ll try to set out the differences as I perceive them\n\nIt is true that any overtuned AI system will cater to the dataset mean—by design. It is also true that we’re seeing more synthetic or generative data used to fill the gaps in human-labeled or human-sourced datasets. It is even more true that the last few years have seen a triumphant eruption of AI-driven art (writing, music, and images at the forefront) and their uses for collaboration with humans or even some that would use the collaborative ability to nearly supplant the human in the process.\n\nI do think there are real risks in continued dataset creation—even today. When we train models to mimic humans and unleash them upon the internet without explicit label (maliciously or not), they impact real human expression. Short-form online writing like Twitter/Reddit/Amazon reviews, traditional sources for ML datasets, are infected with these unlabeled actors and it WILL affect anyone who tries to build a new dataset under the assumption that most data is human in origin. The entire concept of GANs are a real problem here as a tool to refine any filter into a better model and any model into a better filter, perhaps leaving real human output as “poorly performing AI” at some point\n\nI think a lot of my optimism comes from a belief that a large core of human art comes from self-expression and external authenticity. We have had PNGs of the Mona Lisa for decades now, but people still visit the Louvre to see the original not because they *can’t* get a print that large, or light it well, but because there is a human connection in the authenticity of the original work. A large amount of artists operate in a relative degree of unknownness. Their art is increasingly motivated by their own expression rather than recognition for quality, fame, or skill, though many of them will possess these qualities (perhaps even in sufficient amounts). Improved collaboration with AI and solo AI work will certainly change what the “baseline” for becoming famous is, but art is a fickle beast that adversarially deviates from any mean via subversion, so our current techniques are not well-suited to remain ahead of the game.\n\nFinally, in terms of valuation, I do believe AI pose a potentially existential threat to small-time artists IF and perhaps only if society fails to acknowledge the authenticity of pure human or mostly human art with money. A lot of current money flows into these economies from advertising, which doesn’t care about art sources unless people do. But advertising doesn’t want to advertise to bots who won’t spend money (and why would bots start accumulating wealth and spending it) so there should be some economic incentive to keep things from going too far.\n\nThis is not to say your post didn’t raise good points or that your fears are unfounded, just an alternative point of view.

I'm curious to hear what you all think.\n\nIt appears that Siraj recently offered a course \"Make Money with Machine Learning\" with a registration fee but did not follow through with promises made in the initial offering of the course. On top of that, he created a refund and warranty page with information regarding the course *after* people already paid. Here is a link to a WayBackMachine captures of u/klarken's documentation of Siraj's potential misdeeds: [case for a refund](https://web.archive.org/save/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/feedback.html), [discussion in course Discord](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211614/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reference_messages.png), [\\~1200 individuals in the course](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211815/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/members.png), [Multiple Slack channel discussion, students hidden from each other](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923211940/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/multiple_slack_channels.png), [\"Hundreds refunded\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20190923212113/https://case-for-a-refund.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hundreds_refunded.png)\n\nAccording to Twitter threads, he has been banning anyone in his Discord/Slack that has been asking for refunds.\n\nOn top of this there are many Twitter threads regarding his behavior. A screenshot (bottom of post) of an account that has since been deactivated/deleted (he made the account to try and get Siraj's attention). Here is a Twitter WayBackMachine archive link of a search for the user in the screenshot: [https://web.archive.org/web/20190921130513/https:/twitter.com/search?q=safayet96434935&src=typed\\_query](https://web.archive.org/web/20190921130513/https:/twitter.com/search?q=safayet96434935&src=typed_query). In the search results it is apparent that there are many students who have been impacted by Siraj.\n\nUPDATE 1: Additional searching on Twitter has yielded many more posts, check out the tweets/retweets of these people: [student1](https://web.archive.org/save/https:/twitter.com/ReneeSLiu1) [student2](https://web.archive.org/web/20190921133155/https://twitter.com/Aravind56898077)\n\nUPDATE 2: A user mentioned that I should ask a question on r/legaladvice regarding the legality of the refusal to refund and whatnot. I have done so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d7gopa/independent_online_course_false_advertising_and/). It appears that per California commerce law (where the School of AI is registered) individuals have the right to ask for a refund for 30 days.\n\nUPDATE 3: Siraj has replied to the post below, and on [Twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922213957/https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1175864213916372992?s=09) (Way Back Machine capture)\n\nUPDATE 4: Another student has shared their interactions via [this Imgur post](https://imgur.com/gallery/msAdqBn). And another recorded moderators actively suppressing any mentions of refunds [on a live stream](https://web.archive.org/save/https://imgur.com/a/o1TMRY2). [Here is an example](https://imgur.com/a/KhMV6Xo) of assignment quality, note that the assignment is to generate fashion designs not pneumonia prediction.\n\nUPDATE5: Relevant Reddit posts: [Siraj response](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/d7vv1l/d_siraj_apologizes_and_promises_refunds_within_30/), [question about opinions on course two weeks before this](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/cp7kht/guys_what_do_you_think_about_siraj_ravals_new/ewnv00m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), [Siraj-Udacity relationship](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/d8nlqf/n_udacity_had_an_interventional_meeting_with/)\n\nUPDATE6: The Register has [published a piece on the debacle](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/09/27/youtube_ai_star/), Coffezilla [posted a video on all of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jmBE4yPrOs)\n\nUPDATE7: Example of blatant ripoff: GitHub user gregwchase [diabetic retinopathy](https://github.com/gregwchase/dsi-capstone), Siraj's [ripoff](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928160728/https://github.com/llSourcell/AI_in_Medicine_Clinical_Imaging_Classification)\n\nUPDATE8: Siraj has a [new paper and it is plagiarized](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/dh2xfs/d_siraj_has_a_new_paper_the_neural_qubit_its/)\n\nIf you were/are a student in the course and have your own documentation of your interactions, please feel free to bring them to my attention either via DM or in the comments below and I will add them to the main body here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i75r44bku7o31.jpg?width=347&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec2f02ee1998e27ea00d529ffb2086657dc60d77",

This guy is a fake through and through. I actually practice ML as a career but took his course to network and to see what his perspective was on the different industries he was going to talk about.  Part of his course has a Slack workspace where people connect and discuss the course. Some of us couldn't send messages on Slack to each other as we couldn't find our peeps who joined, which we found weird.  We then found out that he had two Slack workspaces going on at the same time, one with about 500 students and the other about 770 students at the time (as of September 4th, 2019).... so there were almost 1200 students enrolled.  He imposed a 500 student limit at the beginning when signing up for the course. Not only did he lie about the 500 max limit of enrollment, he actively hid it from all of us - one Slack workspace didn't know the other Slack workspace existed.  With almost 1200 students, this is the main reason why he was virtually non-existent and not around answering questions.  He couldn't handle having so many students all by himself but he somehow manages to find time posting content on YouTube.  I believe that 500 student limit was his \"clever\" way of creating a FOMO moment so that there were more than 500 signing up which would rake in quite a bit of cash.  Some of us all pooled together and made an official complaint on the larger Slack workspace. \n\nWhen Siraj finally got caught, he decided to own up to his mistakes and apologized for \"making a few exceptions\" which ended up letting more people in than he should have.  When we all purchased the course, he did not have an official refund policy.  As the School of AI is a registered Calfornia business, commerce law mandates that you have 30 days to ask for your money back if you feel dissatisfied with the service if no official refund policy is in place at the time of purchase.\n\nHe tried to circumvent this by handling refunds on a \"case-by-case\" basis and put up a refund policy only \\*after\\* he got caught enrolling more people than he should have.  On top of other issues like lack of availability, not answering many questions he was asked and not hiring TAs to help him with the course, we all started to ask for our money back.  BTW he has some TAs now so I suppose that's one thing going for him.\n\nHe has given some of us our money back (myself included) but there are still some students who have been ignored or have been promised refunds and have not received them yet.  He moved the course over to Discord where his TAs are now running the show and anyone who is asking for a refund has been stifled and kicked from the server.\n\nIn the end, many of us felt disheartened, disenfranchised regarding our right to a voice and lost respect for who Siraj is as a large online presence.  We have left the course but hope that the rest of the students remaining will get something good out of what's left of it. Judging from the comments here, there's no hope in hell of that happening.\n\nEdit: For language and flow",

                    "comment": "Hi guys, really fantastic work, extremely impressive!\n\nI'm an admin at the SC2 AI discord and we had a few questions in our #research channel that you may hopefully be able to shed light on:\n\n1. From the earlier versions (and in fact, the current master version) of pysc2 it appeared that the DM development approach was based on mimicking human gameplay to the fullest extent, e.g. the bot was not even able to get info on anything outside of the screen-view. With this version you seemed to have relaxed these constraints, since feature layers are now \"full map size\" and new features have been added. Is that correct? If so, then how does this really differ from taking the raw data from the API and simply abstracting them into structured data as inputs for the NNs? The blog even suggests that you take raw data and properties directly as data in list form and feed it into the NNs - which seems to suggest that you're not really using feature layers anymore at all?\n2. When I was working with pysc2 it turned out to be an incredibly difficult problem to maintain knowledge of what has been built, is in-progress, has completed, and so on, since I had to pan the camera view all the time to get that information. How is that info kept within the camera_interface approach? Presumably a lot of data must still be available in full via raw data access (e.g. counts of unitTypeID, buildings, etc) even in camera_interface mode? \n3. How many games needed to be played out in order to get to the current level? Or in other words: how many games is 200 years of learning in your case?\n4. How well does the learned knowledge transfer to other maps? Oriol mentioned on discord that it \"worked\" on other maps, and that we should guess which one it worked best on, so I guess it's a good time for the reveal ;) In my personal observations AlphaStar did seem to rely quite a bit on memorized map knowledge. Is it likely that it could execute good wall-offs or proxy cheeses on maps that it has never seen before? What would be the estimated difference in MMR when playing on a completely new map?\n5. How well does it learn the concept of \"save money for X\", e.g. Nexus first. It is not a trivial problem, since if you learn from replays and take the non-actions (NOOPs) from the players into account, the RL algo will more often than not think that NOOP is the best decision at non-ideal points in the game. So how do you handle \"save money for X\" and do you exclude NOOPs in the learning stage?\n6. What step size did you end up using? In the blog you write that each frame of StarCraft is used as one step of input. However, you also mention an average processing time of 50ms, which would exceed real time (which requires < 46ms given 22.4fps). So do you request every step, or every 2nd, 3rd, maybe dynamic?\n\nI have lots more questions, but I guess I'll better ask these in person the next time ;)\n\nThanks!",

I was under the impression it was hard-limited to 180 WPM by the SC2 LE, but watching, the average APM for AS seemed to go far above that for long periods of time, and the DM blog post reproduces the graphs & numbers mentioned without explaining why the APMs were so high.\n2. how many distinct agents does it take in the PBT to maintain adequate diversity to prevent catastrophic forgetting? How does this scale with agent count, or does it only take a few to keep the agents robust? Is there any comparison with the efficiency of the usual strategy of historical checkpoints in?\n3. what does total compute-time in terms of TPU & CPU look like?\n4. the stream was inconsistent. Does the NN run in 50ms or 350ms on a GPU, or were those referring to different things (forward pass vs action restrictions)?\n5. have any tests of generalizations been done? Presumably none of the agents can play different races (as the available units/actions are totally different & don't work even architecture-wise), but there should be at least some generalization to other maps, right?\n5. what other approaches were tried? I know people were quite curious about whether any tree searches, deep environment models, or hierarchical RL techniques would be involved, and it appears none of them were; did any of them make respectable progress if tried? \n\n    Sub-question: do you have any thoughts about pure self-play ever being possible for SC2 given its extreme sparsity? OA5 did manage to get off the ground for DoTA2 without any imitation learning or much domain knowledge, so just being long games with enormous action-spaces doesn't *guarantee* self-play can't work...\n6. speaking of OA5, given the way it seemed to fall apart in slow turtling DoTA2 games or whenever it fell behind, were any checks done to see if the SA self-play lead to similar problems, given the fairly similar overall tendencies of applying constant pressure early on and gradually picking up advantages?\n6. At the November Blizzcon talk, IIRC Vinyals said he'd love to open up their SC2 bot to general play. Any plans for that?\n6. First you do Go dirty, now you do Starcraft. Question: what do you guys have against South Korea?",

BTW, there also appears to be similar work being done [elsewhere](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=2150485517293422106). In the past they have worked with coauthors from: UW Madison, St. Petersburg Polytech, UCSB, Aalborg, etc. (got bored). This is mostly an illustration that any feeling of powerlessness an academic has is unwarranted in this case.\n\nContrary to what many are saying, if you look at their dblps, this line of work seems to have begun in 2016, potentially 2015. And this definitely isn't the creepiest work they have done if you assume that all of their work is done to further their government's population tracking.",

I am posting this because I think it is important for the community to see how research is applied by authoritarian governments to achieve their goals. It is related to a few previous popular posts on this subreddit with high upvotes, which prompted me to post this [story](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/).\n\nPrevious related stories:\n\n- [Is machine learning's killer app totalitarian surveillance and oppression?](https://redd.it/c9n1u2)\n\n- [Using CV for surveillance and regression for threat scoring citizens in Xinjiang](https://redd.it/7kzflw)\n\n- [ICCV 19: The state of some ethically questionable papers](https://redd.it/dp389c)\n\n- [Hikvision marketed ML surveillance camera that automatically identifies Uyghurs](https://redd.it/dv5axp)\n\n- [Working on an ethically questionnable project...](https://redd.it/dw7sms)\n\nThe **[story](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/exposed-chinas-operating-manuals-for-mass-internment-and-arrest-by-algorithm/)** reports the details of a new leak of highly classified Chinese government documents reveals the operations manual for running the mass detention camps in Xinjiang and exposed the mechanics of the region’s system of mass surveillance.\n\n**The [lead journalist](https://twitter.com/BethanyAllenEbr/status/1198663008152621057)'s summary of findings**\n\nThe China Cables represent the first leak of a classified Chinese government document revealing the inner workings of the detention camps, as well as the first leak of classified government documents unveiling the predictive policing system in Xinjiang.\n\nThe leak features classified intelligence briefings that reveal, in the government’s own words, how Xinjiang police essentially take orders from a massive “cybernetic brain” known as IJOP, which flags entire categories of people for investigation & detention.\n\nThese secret intelligence briefings reveal the scope and ambition of the government’s AI-powered policing platform, which purports to predict crimes based on computer-generated findings alone. The result? Arrest by algorithm.\n\n**The article describe methods used for algorithmic policing**\n\nThe classified intelligence briefings reveal the scope and ambition of the government’s artificial-intelligence-powered policing platform, which purports to predict crimes based on these computer-generated findings alone. Experts say the platform, which is used in both policing and military contexts, demonstrates the power of technology to help drive industrial-scale human rights abuses.\n\n“The Chinese [government] have bought into a model of policing where they believe that through the collection of large-scale data run through artificial intelligence and machine learning that they can, in fact, predict ahead of time where possible incidents might take place, as well as identify possible populations that have the propensity to engage in anti-state anti-regime action,” said Mulvenon, the SOS International document expert and director of intelligence integration. “And then they are preemptively going after those people using that data.”\n\nIn addition to the predictive policing aspect of the article, there are side [articles](https://qz.com/1755018/chinas-manual-for-uighur-detention-camps-revealed-in-data-leak/) about the entire ML stack, including how [mobile apps](https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/how-china-targets-uighurs-one-by-one-for-using-a-mobile-app/) are used to target Uighurs, and also how the inmates are [re-educated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50511063) once inside the concentration camps. The documents reveal how every aspect of a detainee's life is monitored and controlled.\n\n*Note: My motivation for posting this story is to raise ethical concerns and awareness in the research community. I do not want to heighten levels of racism towards the Chinese research community (not that it may matter, but I am Chinese). See this [thread](https://redd.it/e10b5x) for some context about what I don't want these discussions to become.*\n\n*I am aware of the fact that the Chinese government's policy is to integrate the state and the people as one, so accusing the party is perceived domestically as insulting the Chinese people, but I also believe that we as a research community is intelligent enough to be able to separate government, and those in power, from individual researchers. We as a community should keep in mind that there are many Chinese researchers (in mainland and abroad) who are not supportive of the actions of the CCP, but they may not be able to voice their concerns due to personal risk.*\n\n**Edit** Suggestion from /u/DunkelBeard:\n\nWhen discussing issues relating to the Chinese government, try to use the term CCP, Chinese Communist Party, Chinese government, or Beijing. Try *not* to use only the term *Chinese* or *China* when describing the government, as it may be misinterpreted as referring to the Chinese people (either citizens of China, or people of Chinese ethnicity), if that is not your intention. As mentioned earlier, conflating China and the CCP is actually a tactic of the CCP.",

Redacting identifying information as the author has appeared to make rectifications, and it’d be pretty damaging if this is what came up when googling their name / GitHub (hopefully they’ve learned a career lesson and can move on). \n\n**TL;DR:** A PhD candidate claimed to have achieved 97% accuracy for coronavirus from chest x-rays. Their post gathered thousands of reactions, and the candidate was quick to recruit branding, marketing, frontend, and backend developers for the project. Heaps of praise all around. He listed himself as a Director of XXXX (redacted), the new name for his project. \n\nThe accuracy was based on a training dataset of ~30 images of lesion / healthy lungs, sharing of data between test / train / validation, and code to train ResNet50 from a PyTorch tutorial.   Nonetheless, thousands of reactions and praise from the “AI | Data Science | Entrepreneur” community. \n\n**Original Post:**\n\nI saw this post circulating on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6645711949554425856-9Dhm\n\nHere, a PhD candidate claims to achieve great performance with “ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE” to predict coronavirus, asks for more help, and garners tens of thousands of views. The repo housing this ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE solution already has a backend, front end, *branding*, a README translated in 6 languages, and a call to spread the word for this wonderful technology. Surely, I thought, this researcher has some great and novel tech for all of this hype? I mean dear god, we have *branding*, and the author has listed himself as the *founder of an organization* based on this project. Anything with this much attention, with dozens of “AI | Data Scientist | Entrepreneur” members of LinkedIn praising it, must have some great merit, right? \n\nLo and behold, we have ResNet50, from torchvision.models import resnet50, with its linear layer replaced. We have a training dataset of 30 images. This should’ve taken at MAX 3 hours to put together - 1 hour for following a tutorial, and 2 for obfuscating the training with unnecessary code. \n\nI genuinely don’t know what to think other than this is bonkers. I hope I’m wrong, and there’s some secret model this author is hiding? If so, I’ll delete this post, but I looked through the repo and (REPO link redacted) that’s all I could find. \n\nI’m at a loss for thoughts. Can someone explain why this stuff trends on LinkedIn, gets thousands of views and reactions, and gets loads of praise from “expert data scientists”? It’s almost offensive to people who are like ... actually working to treat coronavirus and develop real solutions. It also seriously turns me off from pursuing an MS in CV as opposed to CS.\n\nEdit: It turns out there were duplicate images between test / val / training, as if ResNet50 on 30 images wasn’t enough already. \n\nHe’s also posted an update signed as “Director of XXXX (redacted)”. This seems like a straight up sleazy way to capitalize on the pandemic by advertising himself to be the head of a made up organization, pulling resources away from real biomedical researchers.",

The paper noted nearly 300 GPUs being used to train the model. Considering that the first model likely wasn't the one that worked, and parameter searches when it takes 300 GPUs to train a single model, we are talking about experiments with 1000s of GPUs for a single item of research. \n\nDo people at google think about this during their research, or do they look at it as providing knowledge that wouldn't have been possible without Google's deep pockets? Do you think it creates unreasonable expectations for the experiments from labs/groups that can't afford the same resources, or other potential positive/negative impacts in the community? ",

These changes [are forcing many third party apps to shutdown](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/), including [Apollo](https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/), [Reddit is Fun](https://old.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/), [Sync](https://old.reddit.com/r/redditsync/comments/144jp3w/sync_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023/), [Narwhal](https://old.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/), and [many more](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/144o0cs/its_not_just_apollo_other_reddit_apps_are/). Many of the mods here, including me, use one of these apps to help moderate the sub.\n\nFurthermore, it's now clear that Reddit is not acting in good faith. This includes [falsely accusing the creator of Apollo of extortion](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk45rr/?context=3), [ignoring app developers](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk2pp3/) requests to communicate while [saying they are working devs](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk647a/), and [requiring devs who make accessibility-focused apps to do so for free](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk5jfh/)! This mirrors the philosophy they have for moderation: have unpaid volunteers provide millions of hours of unpaid labor for Reddit.\n\nWe [previously asked the community](https://old.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/14265di/should_rmachinelearning_join_the_reddit_blackout/) if we should join [the planned Reddit blackout](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) and the answer was a resounding yes. So, that's what we plan to do. We feel there are enough other platforms for machine learning discussion (Hacker News, Twitter, Mastodon, etc), that people can migrate there in the meantime until Reddit reassesses their latest policy decisions. We hope to see you all on the other side.\n\nSincerely,\nYour r/MachineLearning moderators",

Besides, human benchmarks are meaningless for bots.*\n\n **Problem 1: training data contamination**\n\nTo benchmark GPT-4’s coding ability, OpenAI evaluated it on problems from Codeforces, a website that hosts coding competitions. Surprisingly, Horace He pointed out that GPT-4 solved 10/10 pre-2021 problems and 0/10 recent problems in the easy category. The training data cutoff for GPT-4 is September 2021. This strongly suggests that the model is able to memorize solutions from its training set — or at least partly memorize them, enough that it can fill in what it can’t recall.\n\nAs further evidence for this hypothesis, we tested it on Codeforces problems from different times in 2021. We found that it could regularly solve problems in the easy category before September 5, but none of the problems after September 12.\n\nIn fact, we can definitively show that it has memorized problems in its training set: when prompted with the title of a Codeforces problem, GPT-4 includes a link to the exact contest where the problem appears (and the round number is almost correct: it is off by one). Note that GPT-4 cannot access the Internet, so memorization is the only explanation.",

Out of these, over 95% of the repositories are plagued by this problem. It’s inside PyTorch's official tutorial, OpenAI’s code, and NVIDIA’s projects.

            "description": "TL;DR: The only thing worse than not providing code is saying you did and not following through.\n\nI'm frustrated, so this might be a little bit of a rant but here goes: I cannot believe that it is acceptable in highly ranked conferences to straight-up lie about the availability of code. Firstly, obviously it would be great if everyone released their code all the time because repeatability in ML is pretty dismal at times. But if you're not going to publish your code, then don't say you are. Especially when you're leaving details out of the paper and referring the reader to said \"published\" code.\n\nTake for example [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04725), coming out of NVIDIA's research lab and published in CVPR2020. It is fairly detail-sparse, and nigh on impossible to reproduce in its current state as a result. It refers the reader to [this repository](https://github.com/NVlabs/wetectron) which has been a single readme since its creation. It is simply unacceptable for this when the paper directly says the code has been released.\n\nAs top conferences are starting to encourage the release of code, I think there needs to be another component: the code must actually be available. Papers that link to empty or missing repositories within some kind of reasonable timeframe of publication should be withdrawn. It should be unacceptable to direct readers to code that doesn't exist for details, and similarly for deleting repositories shortly after publication. I get that this is logistically a little tough, because it has to be done after publication, but still we can't let this be considered okay\n\nEDIT: To repeat the TL;DR again and highlight the key point - There won't always be code, that's frustrating but tolerable. There is no excuse for claiming to have code available, but not actually making it available. Code should be required to be up at time of publication, and kept up for some duration, if a paper wishes to claim to have released their code.",

For the record, I personally had emailed one of the authors inquiring about the code but received no reply, even after 2 years of being published the paper (in the ACM DL) still says that the code will released when it is published... go figure.\n\nedit: since this is getting traction, here's another one (of different kind) [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.06561.pdf) by Desai et al. that I found infuriating. In this particular paper the abstract claims the following:\n\n> Finally, we provide easy replication of our studies on APT, a new testbed which makes available not\nonly code and datasets, but also a computing platform with fixed environmental settings.\n\nwhich is misleading to say the least, as I tried to get access to it and it was impossible; not only had I to register an account but also had to *ask* for permission, which I never got. Further, again like the previous paper, emailed the lead author for clarifications and/or provide the actual code but got no response... Though, the fact that the (impossible) reproducibility made it to the abstract is hilarious!\n\nHurray for reproducible science! As others have said, if you do not plan on releasing the code - *please* do **not** claim that as a bonus point in your paper; as, in my opinion, doing so and not honoring that should be a retractable offense.",

The workshop is cancelled, and that’s all,” Guillaume Belanger, an astrophysicist and the INTEGRAL Science Operations Coordinator at the ESA, told The Register on Monday.\n\nRaval isn’t about to quit his work any time soon, however. He promised students who graduated from his course that they would be referred to recruiters at Nvidia, Intel, Google and Amazon for engineering positions, or matched with a startup co-founder or a consulting client.\n\nIn an unlisted YouTube video recorded live for his students discussing week eight of his course, and seen by El Reg, he read out a question posed to him: “Will your referrals hold any value now?”\n\n“Um, yeah they’re going to hold value. I don’t see why they wouldn’t. I mean, yes, some people on Twitter were angry but that has nothing to do with… I mean… I’ve also had tons of support, you know. I’ve had tons of support from people, who, uh, you know, support me, who work at these companies.\n\n*He continues to justify his actions:*\n\n“Public figures called me in private to remind me that this happens. You know, people make mistakes. You just have to keep going. They’re basically just telling me to not to stop. Of course, you make mistakes but you just keep going,” he claimed.\n\n*When The Register asked Raval for comment, he responded:*\n\n**I've hardly taken any time off to relax since I first started my YouTube channel almost four years ago. And despite the enormous amount of work it takes to release two high quality videos a week for my audience, I progressively started to take on multiple other projects simultaneously by myself – a book, a docu-series, podcasts, YouTube videos, the course, the school of AI. Basically, these past few weeks, I've been experiencing a burnout unlike anything I've felt before. As a result, all of my output has been subpar.**\n\n**I made the [neural qubits] video and paper in one week. I remember wishing I had three to six months to really dive into quantum machine-learning and make something awesome, but telling myself I couldn't take that long as it would hinder my other projects. I plagiarized large chunks of the paper to meet my self-imposed one-week deadline. The associated video with animations took a lot more work to make. I didn't expect the paper to be cited as serious research, I considered it an additional reading resource for people who enjoyed the associated video to learn more about quantum machine learning. If I had a second chance, I'd definitely take way more time to write the paper, and in my own words.**\n\n**I've given refunds to every student who's asked so far, and the majority of students are still enrolled in the course. There are many happy students, they're just not as vocal on social media. We're on week 8 of 10 of my course, fully committed to student success.**\n\n“And, no, I haven't plagiarized research for any other paper,” he added.\n\nhttps://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/14/ravel_ai_youtube/",

            "description": "I was not going to post this but something wrong is happening here in this subreddit which forced my hands.\n\n\nThis week two posts relating to machine learning were posted here one is about [How visual search works](https://thomasdelteil.github.io/VisualSearch_MXNet/) and other about [generating ramen](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8l5w56/p_generative_ramen/). The former post contains a small write up, source code and a demo site to explain how visual search works and the latter just have a gif of generated  ramen probably with a GAN. The irony is that the post which has more information and source code for reproducing that work got only about 25 votes and the one with gif only with no source code or explanation provided got more than 1000 votes (not so unique work any one with basic understanding of GAN can make one). Today the most upvoted post here is about [a circle generating GAN](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8mgs8k/p_visualisation_of_a_gan_learning_to_generate_a/) which also has only a gif with brief explanation as comment and no source code. Are you seeing a pattern here?\n\nThe problem I mentioned above is not a one of case, I am a regular lurker in this subreddit and for the past few months I started seeing some disturbing patterns in posts posted here. People who posts gif/movie/photo only post tends to get more upvotes than the posts with full source code or explanation.  I agree some original research posts [such as this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc5P2bvfl44&feature=youtu.be&t=7s) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y__pYj9UHfc) can be only be released as videos and not the source code because of its commercial value. But most of the gif/movie/photo only posts here are not at all original research but they used a already know algorithm with a different dataset (eg: Ramen generation). \n\nThe problem here is If we continue this type of posts people will stop sharing their original works, source code or explanation and then starts sharing this type of end result only posts which will get less scrutiny and more votes. In future, this will not only decrease the quality of this subreddit but also its a greater danger to the open nature of Machine learning field. What's the point in posting a github project link or blogpost here when we can get much more votes with a gif alone?.\n\n*I am not a academician but I use r/MachineLearning to find blogs, articles and projects which explains/program recent discoveries in AI which then I myself can try out.*\n",

It learned how to play games by doing prediction, identifying  violation of expectations, and exploring areas that it did not know  about.  This leads in the direction that AI will need to go:    self-supervision, unlabeled data, prediction, curiosity, intrinsic  motivation, etc.  There is not enough time in the world for humans to  produce supervised training sets and define metrics on those data sets.   If, instead, you provide the AI with the raw data from a system (or the  natural world) and it can learn internal representations of the  spatiotemporal evolution of that system, **then** you can define a goal and the AI will be able to achieve it.  \n\n​\n\nRunner up:   **Learning Unsupervised Learning Rules**, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00222](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00222).

Meta-learning  is a key area, where learning the learning rules will allow AI's to  understand themselves, and (eventually) improve themselves in general.   If you can teach a computer about how it learns, and it learns how to  explore how it learns, then we have a chance at takeoff.  ",

Not only there has been relatively little progress done to LLM performance and design improvements after GPT4: the primary way to make it better is still just to make it bigger and all alternative architectures to transformer proved to be subpar and inferior, they drive attention (and investment) away from other, potentially more impactful technologies. This is in combination with influx of people without any kind of knowledge of how even basic machine learning works, claiming to be \"AI Researcher\" because they used GPT for everyone to locally  host a model, trying to convince you that \"language models totally can reason. We just need another RAG solution!\" whose sole goal of being in this community is not to develop new tech but to use existing in their desperate attempts to throw together a profitable service. Even the papers themselves are beginning to be largely written by LLMs. I can't help but think that the entire field might plateau simply because the ever growing community is content with mediocre fixes that at best make the model score slightly better on that arbitrary \"score\" they made up, ignoring the glaring issues like hallucinations, context length, inability of basic logic and sheer price of running models this size.

I mean it's either LLM or a diffusion model. \nHowever, I still feel that people are still trying to work in a variety of fields - it's just that they don't get the same media attention. Continual learning is growing, people have started combining neural odes with flows/diffusion to reduce time, Neural radiance field and implicit neural networks are also being worked upon as far as I know. Also in neurips 2023, a huge climate dataset was released which is good.\nI also suggest that you go through the state space models (Mamba and it's predecessors) where they are trying to solve the context length and quadratic time by using some neat maths tricks. As for models with real logical processes, I do not know much about them but my hunch says we probably need RL for it.",

I realize that its difficult to stomach rejection, and I empathize with you as I'm submitting as well and will likely get a reject as well.\n\nBut please, please, please, please, as someone who has already spent 20-30 hours reviewing this week, and will likely be spending another 30-40 hours this week on the reviewing process. Please!\n\nStop submitting unfinished work to conferences.\n\nAt this point more than half of the papers I'm reviewing are clearly unfinished work. They have significant, unmistakable flaws to the point that no reasonable person can believe that this work could possibly appear in a peer reviewed, top tier conference. No reasonable person can put these submitted papers next to even the worst ICML paper from the last few years, and believe that yeah, they're of similar or higher quality.\n\nPlease take the time to get your work reviewed by your peers, or even your advisor prior to submission. If they can find \\*any\\* flaw in your work, I assure you, your reviewers are going to find so many flaws and give you a hurtful, and demoralizing review.\n\nI realize that we're all in a huge hype bubble, and we all want to ride the hype train, but reviewing these unfinished works makes me feel so disrespected by the authors. They're clearly submitting for early feedback. It's not fair to the conference system and the peer review process to ask your reviewers to do \\*unpaid\\* research work for you and advise you on how to construct and present your work. It's not fair to treat your reviewers as free labor.\n\nIt takes me at a \\*minimum\\* 6-7 hours to review one paper, and more likely 10+ hours. That's 10+ hours of my life that these authors think is entitled to them to help them in their research so they can get published. It makes me feel so disrespected, and quite honestly, makes me want to give up on signing up as a reviewer if this is the quality of work I am expected to review.\n\nNot only are these authors being selfish, but they're hurting the overall research community, conference quality, and the peer review process. More unfinished work being submitted, means reviewers have a higher workload. We don't get to spend as much time on each paper as we would like to, meaning \\*good well written deserving papers\\* either get overlooked, unfairly rejected, or get terrible feedback. This is simply unacceptable!\n\nThese authors, quite honestly, are acting like those people who hoard toilet paper during an epidemic. They act selfishly to the detriment of the community, putting themselves above both the research process, and other authors who submit good work.\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE don't do this. Submit finished, good work, that you think is ready for publication and peer review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold award kind stranger. You make me feel a little better about my week.\n\nEdit2: Thanks for the platinum. Thanks for the support/discussion guys.\n\n&#x200B;",

StableLM is trained on a new experimental dataset built on “The Pile” from EleutherAI (a 825GiB diverse, open source language modeling data set that consists of 22 smaller, high quality datasets combined together!)

I understand that they've started integrating them along the way, but still, it seems like it hapenned way too fast. This tweet encompases the past few weeks perfectly [https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1638235815137386508) , on a random Tuesday countless products are released that seem revolutionary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to the language models, there are also the generative art models that have been slowly rising in mainstream recognition. Now Midjourney AI is known by a lot of people who are not even remotely connected to the AI space.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the past few weeks, reading Twitter, I've felt completely overwhelmed, as if the entire AI space is moving beyond at lightning speed, whilst around me we're just slowly training models, adding some data, and not seeing much improvement, being stuck on coming up with \"new ideas, that set us apart\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWatching the GTC keynote from NVIDIA I was again, completely overwhelmed by how much is being developed throughout all the different domains. The ASML EUV (microchip making system) was incredible, I have no idea how it does lithography and to me it still seems like magic. The Grace CPU with 2 dies (although I think Apple was the first to do it?) and 100 GB RAM, all in a small form factor. There were a lot more different hardware servers that I just blanked out at some point. The omniverse sim engine looks incredible, almost real life (I wonder how much of a domain shift there is between real and sim considering how real the sim looks). Beyond it being cool and usable to train on synthetic data, the car manufacturers use it to optimize their pipelines. This change in perspective, of using these tools for other goals than those they were designed for I find the most interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe hardware part may be old news, as I don't really follow it, however the software part is just as incredible. NVIDIA AI foundations (language, image, biology models), just packaging everything together like a sandwich. Getty, Shutterstock and Adobe will use the generative models to create images. Again, already these huge juggernauts are already integrated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't believe the point where we're at. We can use AI to write code, create art, create audiobooks using Britney Spear's voice, create an interactive chatbot to converse with books, create 3D real-time avatars, generate new proteins (?i'm lost on this one), create an anime and countless other scenarios. Sure, they're not perfect, but the fact that we can do all that in the first place is amazing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs Huang said in his keynote, companies want to develop \"disruptive products and business models\". I feel like this is what I've seen lately. Everyone wants to be the one that does something first, just throwing anything and everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I'm feeling like the world is moving so fast around me whilst I'm standing still. I want to not read anything anymore and just wait until everything dies down abit, just so I can get my bearings. However, I think this is unfeasible. I fear we'll keep going in a frenzy until we just burn ourselves at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow are you all fairing? How do you feel about this frenzy in the AI space? What are you the most excited about?",

They continue to rename methods discovered earlier DESPITE admitting the existence of this work.\n\nSee this new paper they released:\n\n[https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14536](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14536)\n\nStop calling this method SWISH; its original name is SILU. The original Swish authors from Google even admitted to this mistake in the past ([https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r\\_swish\\_a\\_selfgated\\_activation\\_function\\_google/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/)). And the worst part is this new paper has the very same senior author as the previous Google paper.\n\nAnd just a couple weeks ago, the same issue again with the SimCLR paper. See thread here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hbzd5o/d\\_on\\_the\\_public\\_advertising\\_of\\_neurips/fvcet9j/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hbzd5o/d_on_the_public_advertising_of_neurips/fvcet9j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nThey site only cite prior work with the same idea in the last paragraph of their supplementary and yet again rename the method to remove its association to the prior work. This is unfair. Unfair to the community and especially unfair to the lesser known researchers who do not have the advertising power of Geoff Hinton and Quoc Le on their papers.\n\nSiLU/Swish is by Stefan Elfwing, Eiji Uchibe, Kenji Doya ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03118](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03118)).\n\nOriginal work of SimCLR is by Mang Ye, Xu Zhang, Pong C. Yuen, Shih-Fu Chang ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03436](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03436))\n\nUpdate:\n\nDan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel also proposed the SiLU non-linearity in 2016 in their work Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs) ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415))\n\nUpdate 2:\n\n\"Smooth Adversarial Training\" by Cihang Xie is only an example of the renaming issue because of issues in the past by Google to properly assign credit. Cihang Xie's work is not the cause of this issue. Their paper does not claim to discover a new activation function. They are only using the SiLU activation function in some of their experiments under the name Swish. [Cihang Xie will provide an update of the activation function naming used in the paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hkiyir/r\\_google\\_has\\_a\\_credit\\_assignment\\_problem\\_in/fwtttqo?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x) to reflect the correct naming. \n\nThe cause of the issue is Google in the past decided to continue with renaming the activation as [Swish despite being made aware of the method already having the name SiLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05941). Now it is stuck in our research community and stuck in our ML libraries (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/41066).",

My work is about studying how different activation functions behave during adversarial training — we find smooth activation functions (e.g., SoftPlus, ELU, GELU) significantly work better than the non-smooth ReLU.\n\n==================================\nI am the first author of the “smooth adversarial training” paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14536), and thanks for bringing the issue here.\n\nFirst of all, I agree with the suggestion and will correct the naming of the activation function in the next revision. \n\nNonetheless, it seems that there are some confusions/misunderstandings w.r.t. the position/contribution of this paper, and I want to clarify as below:\n\n(1) In our smooth adversarial training paper, we have cited SILU [9], but it is our fault to only refer to the name of SWISH. We will explicitly refer to SILU instead.\n\n(2) The design of SILU/SWISH is not claimed as the contribution of this paper. Our core message is that applying smooth activation functions in adversarial training will significantly boost performance. In other words,  as long as your activation functions are smooth (e.g., SILU, SoftPlus, ELU), they will do much better than ReLU in adversarial training. \n\nThanks for the feedback!",

Thank you for bringing this particular example to my attention. I had been meaning to do this for a while but didn’t have the right example on hand (obviously without good examples you’d get crucified for *daring* to suggest Google or Mircosoft are anything other than paragons of virtue).\n\n**Edit:** In my original tweet I confused two papers. I have made a new twitter thread correcting that mistake and changed the link to point at my new thread.\n\n**Edit 2:** For those of you two dislike Twitter, here's the content of what I wrote:\n\nGroups like @MSFTResearch @GoogleAI @NVIDIAAI etc have far greater marketing power and greater reach than people at most universities, let alone everyday peons. When they rename other people’s techniques those names are far more likely to catch on due to marketing power. It’s great that large companies and famous researchers want to advance techniques invented by other people. But renaming these techniques, even when they’re cited properly, is stealing and has real down-stream effects on how people assign credit and think about ideas. Works should celebrate what comes before them, not diminish it. If you add your own spin on ideas, modify or extend the names assigned by inventors; don’t rename them. It doesn’t make you any less of a researcher to extend other people’s ideas. It makes you a better one.\n\nWe all know that names have power. There’s a reason so many papers are titled CATCHY_NAME: DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Names are sticky. Catchy names are remembered far more easily than descriptive titles. It’s important to consider the importance of names when talking about plagiarism. Searching for terms like “swish activation function” or “swish ml paper” do not bring up the original work. They only bring up Microsoft’s paper extending it. It also brings up many blogs and posts that seem unaware that the idea had been previously introduced.\n\nOn a personal level, I am working on a extending the fabulous paper [SafetyNets: Verifiable Execution of Deep Neural Networks on an Untrusted Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10268) by Zahra Ghodsi et al. I would never dream of renaming her idea, and am currently thinking of calling my extension of her technique “[adjective] SafetyNets.” (I do not believe that she’s on twitter, but please let me know if I’m wrong so I can tag her.)\n\nTL;DR Even if the prior work is cited properly, renaming ideas introduced by other people makes their work much harder to find for future researchers who can remember a catchy name much more easily than a descriptive title. Using someone else’s technique and renaming it so that your new name doesn’t connect to their paper is functionally plagiarism and is a big problem at large AI companies where they have much better marketing than most researchers.\n\n**Edit 3:** A point of clarification: the recent paper by Cihang did not coin the term “SWISH.” That term was coined by an earlier paper from the same group that has the same senior author, but otherwise disjoint authorship. Cihang et al. used the SWISH terminology introduced by someone else. I did not always distinguish between the two papers clearly because I had thought that the authorship overlap was much more significant than just the senior author.",

            "description": "TL;DR for those who dont want to read the full rant. \n\nSpent hours performing feature selection,data preprocessing, pipeline building, choosing a model that gives decent results on all metrics and extensive testing only to lose to someone who used a model that was clearly overfitting on a dataset that was clearly broken, all because the other team was using \"deep learning\". Are buzzwords all that matter to execs?\n\n\n\nI've been learning Machine Learning for the past 2 years now. Most of my experience has been with Deep Learning. \n\nRecently, I participated in a Hackathon. The Problem statement my team picked was \"Anomaly detection in Network Traffic using Machine Learning/Deep Learning\". Us being mostly a DL shop, thats the first approach we tried. We found an open source dataset about cyber attacks on servers, lo and behold, we had a val accuracy of 99.8 in a single epoch of a simple feed forward net, with absolutely zero data engineering....which was way too good to be true. Upon some more EDA and some googling we found two things, one, three of the features had a correlation of more than 0.9 with the labels, which explained the ridiculous accuracy, and two, the dataset we were using had been repeatedly criticized since it's publication for being completely unlike actual data found in network traffic. This thing (the name of the dataset is kddcup99, for those interested ) was really old (published in 1999) and entirely synthetic. The people who made it completely fucked up and ended up producing a dataset that was almost linear. \n\nTo top it all off, we could find no way to extract over half of the features listed in that dataset, from real time traffic, meaning a model trained on this data could never be put into production, since there was no way to extract the correct features from the incoming data during inference.\n\nWe spent the next hour searching for a better source of data, even trying out unsupervised approaches like auto encoders, finally settling on a newer, more robust dataset, generated from real data (titled UNSW-NB15, published 2015, not the most recent my InfoSec standards, but its the best we could find). \nCue almost 18 straight, sleepless hours of determining feature importance, engineering and structuring the data (for eg. we had to come up with our own solutions to representing IP addresses and port numbers, since encoding either through traditional approaches like one-hot was just not possible), iterating through different models,finding out where the model was messing up, and preprocessing data to counter that, setting up pipelines for taking data captures in raw pcap format, converting them into something that could be fed to the model, testing out the model one random pcap files found around the internet, simulating both postive and negative conditions (we ran port scanning attacks on our own machines and fed the data of the network traffic captured during the attack to the model), making sure the model was behaving as expected with a balanced accuracy, recall and f1_score, and after all this we finally built a web interface where the user could actually monitor their network traffic and be alerted if there were any anomalies detected, getting a full report of what kind of anomaly, from what IP, at what time, etc. \n\nAfter all this we finally settled on using a RandomForestClassifier, because the DL approaches we tried kept messing up because of the highly skewed data (good accuracy, shit recall) whereas randomforests did a far better job handling that. We had a respectable 98.8 Acc on the test set, and similar recall value of 97.6. We didn't know how the other teams had done but we were satisfied with our work. \n\nDuring the judging round, after 15 minutes of explaining all of the above to them, the only question the dude asked us was \"so you said you used a nueral network with 99.8 Accuracy, is that what your final result is based on?\". We then had to once again explain why that 99.8 accuracy was absolutely worthless, considering the data itself was worthless and how Neural Nets hadn't shown themselves to be very good at handling data imbalance (which is important considering the fact that only a tiny percentage of all network traffic is anomalous). The judge just muttered \"so its not a Neural net\", to himself, and walked away. \n\nWe lost the competetion, but I was genuinely excited to know what approach the winning team took until i asked them, and found out ....they used a fucking neural net on kddcup99 and that was all that was needed. Is that all that mattered to the dude? That they used \"deep learning\". What infuriated me even more was this team hadn't done anything at all with the data, they had no fucking clue that it was broken, and when i asked them if they had used a supervised feed forward net or unsupervised autoencoders, the dude looked at me as if I was talking in Latin....so i didnt even lose to a team using deep learning , I lost to one pretending to use deep learning. \n\nI know i just sound like a salty loser but it's just incomprehensible to me. The judge was a representative of a startup that very proudly used \"Machine Learning to enhance their Cyber Security Solutions, to provide their users with the right security for todays multi cloud environment\"....and they picked a solution with horrible recall, tested on an unreliable dataset, that could never be put into production over everything else ( there were two more teams thay used approaches similar to ours but with slightly different preprocessing and final accuracy metrics). But none of that mattered...they judged entirely based on two words. Deep. Learning. Does having actual knowledge of Machine Learning and Datascience actually matter or should I just bombard people with every buzzword I know to get ahead in life.",

I am responsible for acquiring data from all sorts of sources in all sorts of formats, cleaning it, and turning it into something data scientists can play with. This usually involves building data pipelines to stick the data in a database, providing support for data-scientists, and finally productionising any insights.\n\nThroughout the exploration process, the data scientists constantly come back and ask me how to do a particular thing, or if i can change the dataset in a particular way, or enrich it from other sources, or write them some complex query or show them how to do some graph or whatever.\n\nWhen they are done, they end up with a pretty messy code, which gives some insights from the data. In my experience data-scientists are usually not good coders. I don't mean to dis them, they do very clever things I am not able to do using mathematics, but coding isn't something they usually are very good at or have patience to, they usually see it as more of an annoyance in their way.\n\nIt's then up to me to clean up their code and move it from the modeling stage (which is usually in jupyter, pandas or even excel) into some reproducible production service so that a new data-point can be classified.\n\nThis step is usually pretty easy, since it mostly involves throwing away a ton of their code, writing some basic sanity tests and trimming it down to a function that takes in a datapoint and spits out some score, or a graph, or some other useful output. I just have to take that, stick it in some flask micro-service, dockerise it, and do all the annoying things around it, CI/CD, documenting the new REST endpoint in swagger, and general admin.\n\nI kinda understand what they do, after they finish the analysis it kinda makes intuitive sense (I have \\_some\\_ background in statistics and mathematics), but the exploration bit is something I won't be able to do very well, and it's where I believe they should spend most of their time.\n\nAnd yes, it's damn boring and unrewarding. It involves a huge stack of technologies, from systems to software development. I have to be very proficient in everything: SQL, XPath, JSONPath, RegExps, Python, Javascript, unix systems, hardware and acceleration, millions of libraries for maths and sciences, I have to keep up with the latest everything, and to check out every time google or amazon decide to roll out a new ML related tech.\n\nIt's a lot of work, which basically means that when I'm done the DS (or sometimes quants) can get a bunch of tables with clean data. they then spend hours just looking at these tables, poking around, making graphs, building models, and figuring out what they can tell from the data.\n\nIt's one of these jobs, the CEO doesn't know what I'm doing, the only people that appreciate what I'm doing are the data scientists. It doesn't really show in the presentation yet it's like 90% of the workload.\n\nThere are long discussions between data-scientists and management before a new project, which all too often I am not involved in. The data-scientists promise a ton of things they just cannot do, and the engineering part of everything is all too often overlooked. they lay down requirements, which I am expected to turn into specs, but often without knowing the end goals. I can lay down a decent action plan, and design a decent large system, but I can do it better if I am involved in all stages, not just getting dumped a load of requirements on. in which case I usually just keep a small mind and do as I'm told, but the end product would be significantly better if we are involved from the grounds up. pure data science itself is only a piece of the puzzle.\n\nI really don't want this to be interpreted as disrespect for data-scientists, it's a profession I have a lot of respect for, and I enjoy the satisfaction of making their work lighter, I worked with some very smart and interesting people, but yeah, data science is like 90% admin.\n\nEdit: Thanks :)",

As an ML engineer I get to build end-to-end ML pipelines that run automatically, and once it's pushed into production there's a more definitive sense of accomplishment. \n\nTo each their own I guess, but I feel like the engineering side unlocks the true potential/utility of ML. I get to build things that actually do stuff that I can sign off on and then move on to the next project, vs perpetually tweaking cool models and fancy graphs...\n\nBut if you work in a larger team you may very well end up focusing mainly on the data science part and do more of the exploratory stuff, if that floats your boat. As my team has grown my focus has shifted more and more to the engineering side, and it is definitely my favorite part of it.

Too many recommendations of this type\n\nThese suggests that they optimized the recommendations based on their internal metrics. I strongly suspect it is click through rate.

For my kids they get their rhymes on the home page and they are happy. \n\nOptimizing the click through rate is completely bad for discovery. That's what precisely happened here. I find Tiktok recommendations more in line with my taste. Its true that I do mark 10 to 15% of videos as not interested but other 85% is worth it. Youtube took another route.

            "description": "\nHey Reddit,\n\nI’ve been in an AI/ML role for a few years now, and I’m starting to feel disconnected from the work. When I started, deep learning models were getting good, and I quickly fell in love with designing architectures, training models, and fine-tuning them for specific use cases. Seeing a loss curve finally converge, experimenting with layers, and debugging training runs—it all felt like a craft, a blend of science and creativity. I enjoyed implementing research papers to see how things worked under the hood. Backprop, gradients, optimization—it was a mental workout I loved.\n\nBut these days, it feels like everything has shifted. LLMs dominate the scene, and instead of building and training models, the focus is on using pre-trained APIs, crafting prompt chains, and setting up integrations. Sure, there’s engineering involved, but it feels less like creating and more like assembling. I miss the hands-on nature of experimenting with architectures and solving math-heavy problems.\n\nIt’s not just the creativity I miss. The economics of this new era also feel strange to me. Back when I started, compute was a luxury. We had limited GPUs, and a lot of the work was about being resourceful—quantizing models, distilling them, removing layers, and squeezing every bit of performance out of constrained setups. Now, it feels like no one cares about cost. We’re paying by tokens. Tokens! Who would’ve thought we’d get to a point where we’re not designing efficient models but feeding pre-trained giants like they’re vending machines?\n\nI get it—abstraction has always been part of the field. TensorFlow and PyTorch abstracted tensor operations, Python abstracts C. But deep learning still left room for creation. We weren’t just abstracting away math; we were solving it. We could experiment, fail, and tweak. Working with LLMs doesn’t feel the same. It’s like fitting pieces into a pre-defined puzzle instead of building the puzzle itself.\n\nI understand that LLMs are here to stay. They’re incredible tools, and I respect their potential to revolutionize industries. Building real-world products with them is still challenging, requiring a deep understanding of engineering, prompt design, and integrating them effectively into workflows. By no means is it an “easy” task. But the work doesn’t give me the same thrill. It’s not about solving math or optimization problems—it’s about gluing together APIs, tweaking outputs, and wrestling with opaque systems. It’s like we’ve traded craftsmanship for convenience.\n\nWhich brings me to my questions:\n\n1. Is there still room for those of us who enjoy the deep work of model design and training? Or is this the inevitable evolution of the field, where everything converges on pre-trained systems?\n\n\n2. What use cases still need traditional ML expertise? Are there industries or problems that will always require specialized models instead of general-purpose LLMs?\n\n\n3. Am I missing the bigger picture here? LLMs feel like the “kernel” of a new computing paradigm, and we don’t fully understand their second- and third-order effects. Could this shift lead to new, exciting opportunities I’m just not seeing yet?\n\n\n4. How do you stay inspired when the focus shifts? I still love AI, but I miss the feeling of building something from scratch. Is this just a matter of adapting my mindset, or should I seek out niches where traditional ML still thrives?\n\n\n\nI’m not asking this to rant (though clearly, I needed to get some of this off my chest). I want to figure out where to go next from here. If you’ve been in AI/ML long enough to see major shifts—like the move from feature engineering to deep learning—how did you navigate them? What advice would you give someone in my position?\n\nAnd yeah, before anyone roasts me for using an LLM to structure this post (guilty!), I just wanted to get my thoughts out in a coherent way. Guess that’s a sign of where we’re headed, huh?\n\nThanks for reading, and I’d love to hear your thoughts!\n\nTL;DR: I entered AI during the deep learning boom, fell in love with designing and training models, and thrived on creativity, math, and optimization. Now it feels like the field is all about tweaking prompts and orchestrating APIs for pre-trained LLMs. I miss the thrill of crafting something unique. Is there still room for people who enjoy traditional ML, or is this just the inevitable evolution of the field? How do you stay inspired amidst such shifts?\n\nUpdate: Wow, this blew up. Thanks everyone for your comments and suggestions. I really like some of those. This thing was on my mind for a long time, glad that I put it here. Thanks again!",

I started out as a 13 year old in 2010 and fell in love with programming for the exact same reason you describe - the build aspect. The blend of creativity, math, and science felt like a never-ending rush of dopamine. Building something from what seemed like nothing was like magic to me. Now, everything has already been built, and everything exists as either a framework, out-of-the-box solution, or no-code product. It's of course great that technology has come this far and made it this convenient, but - like you - I'm struggling to get the same joy out of programming as I used to.\n\nI recently decided to try to pursue a PhD and go into research to use ML for that, since the use cases tend to be more niche. Plus, there's the whole science domain that adds an extra flavour to me (I have a science degree, so can cross-bridge the fields). It seems to me that the only way to escape boxed solutions is to not follow and use the latest state-of-the-art. It's to be *at* the frontier itself, helping shape and build what is to come, whether that be in science, ML, or a combination. This will be hard to find in industry, since most of industry is focused on using existing solutions to generate more profit - but there are some firms out there willing to experiment as well.\n\nThat would be my advice to you, i.e. to seek out the frontier. Be at the edge where the answers end and the unanswered questions still stand. The technology has moved forward, and so must we.",

Now you pull your latest framework and library of choice and have an endpoint on a few seconds. You need a queuing solution? There's 6 products for that. A database?

So the only route for you if you enjoyed the hard bits of engineering is to find the 10%. The indie studio that is still building their own game engine. The open source team writing the service frameworks.

They likely still care about costs like you're saying. Or find the indie studio that has a problem that LLM's don't solve.\n\nThe issue with democratization is that the job market becomes filled with a ton of people and roles for specialists tend to be hard to find in the noise.

We are now using LLMs for even traditional NLP tasks that are more effectively solved, in terms of both compute and quality, with traditional ML or BERT style models.\n\nSometimes I can win these disagreements, but LLM costs are trending quickly downwards and once the cost isn’t on my side there won’t be nearly as good of an argument for custom made solutions, which will make the work very boring/unrewarding. \n\nI think in the near ish future if you want to build models you just have to get a job at a model building company (ai21, cohere, anthropic, oai, etc). From what I’ve seen even big tech are relying more on these companies than their own internal models (maybe Google is an exception, I don’t have good insights about what’s going on there).",

            "description": "When visualizing the inner workings of vision transformers (ViTs), researchers noticed weird spikes of attention on random background patches. This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.\n\nBy analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.\n\nThe high-norm \"outlier\" tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.\n\nTheir hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.\n\nTheir fix is simple - just add dedicated \"register\" tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.\n\nModels trained with registers have:\n\n* Smoother and more meaningful attention maps\n* Small boosts in downstream performance\n* Way better object discovery abilities\n\nThe registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up. Just a tiny architecture tweak improves interpretability and performance. Sweet!\n\nI think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.\n\nTLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems. Adding dedicated register tokens for storage fixes it nicely.\n\n[**Full summary**](https://notes.aimodels.fyi/demystifying-the-artifacts-in-vision-transformer-models/)**.** Paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16588.pdf).",

            "description": "# Background\n\nI recently graduated with a master's degree and was fortunate/unfortunate to glimpse the whole \"Academic\" side of ML. I took a thesis track in my degree because as an immigrant it's harder to get into a good research lab without having authorship in a couple of good papers  (Or so I delude myself ). \n\nI worked as a Full-stack SWE for a startup for 4+ years before coming to the US for a master’s degree focused on ML and AI. I did everything in those years. From project management to building fully polished S/W products to DevOps to even dabbled in ML. I did my Batchelor’s degree from a university whose name is not even worth mentioning. The university for my master’s degree is in the top 20 in the AI space.  I didn't know much about ML and the curiosity drove me to university.  \n\nCome to uni and I focused on learning ML and AI for one 1-1.5 years after which I found advisors for a thesis topic. This is when the fun starts. I had the most amazing advisors but the entire peer review system and the way we assess ML/Science is what ticked me off. This is where the rant begins. \n\n# Rant 1:Acadmia follows a Gated Institutional Narrative\n\nLet's say you are a Ph.D. at the world's top AI institution working under the best prof. You have a way higher likelihood of you getting a good Postdoc at a huge research lab vs someone's from my poor country doing a Ph.D. with a not-so-well-known advisor having published not-so-well-known papers. I come from a developing nation and I see this many times here. In my country academics don't get funding as they do at colleges in the US. One of the reasons for this is that colleges don't have such huge endowments and many academics don't have wealthy research sponsors.  Brand names and prestige carry massive weight to help get funding in US academic circles. This prestige/money percolates down to the students and the researchers who work there. Students in top colleges get a huge advantage and the circles of top researchers keep being from the same sets of institutions. I have nothing against top researchers from top institutions but due to the nature of citations and the way the money flows based on them, a vicious cycle is created where the best institutions keep getting better and the rest don't get as much of a notice. \n\n# Rant 2: Peer Review without Code Review in ML/AI is shady \n\nI am a computer scientist and I was appalled when I heard that you don't need to do code reviews for research papers. As a computer scientist and someone who actually did shit tons of actual ML in the past year, I find it absolutely garbage that code reviews are not a part of this system. I am not saying every scientist who reads a paper should review code but at least one person should for any paper's code submission. At least in ML and AI space. This is basic. I don't get why people call themselves computer scientists if they don't want to read the fucking code. If you can't then make a grad student do it. But for the collective of science, we need this.  \n\n***The core problem lies in the fact that peer review is free. :*** There should be better solutions for this. We ended up creating Git and that changed so many lives. Academic Research needs something similar.\n\n# Rant 3: My Idea is Novel Until I see Someone Else's Paper\n\nThe volume of scientific research is growing exponentially. Information is being created faster than we can digest.  We can't expect people to know everything and the amount of overlap in the AI/ML fields requires way better search engines than Google Scholar. \n\nThe side effect of large volumes of research is that every paper is doing something \"novel\" making it harder to filter what the fuck was novel. \n\nI have had so many experiences where I coded up something and came to realize that someone else has done something symbolically similar and my work just seems like a small variant of that. That's what fucks with my head. Is what I did in Novel? What the fuck is Novel? Is stitching up a transformer to any problem with fancy embeddings and tidying it up as a research paper Novel? Is just making a transformer bigger Novel?  Is some new RL algorithm tested with 5 seeds and some fancy fucking prior and some esoteric reasoning for its success Novel? Is using an over parameterized model to get 95% accuracy on 200 sample test set Novel? Is apply Self-supervised learning for some new dataset Novel? If I keep on listing questions on novelty, I can probably write a novel asking about what the fuck is \"Novel\". \n\n# Rant 4: Citation Based Optimization Promotes Self Growth Over Collective Growth\n\nWhatever people may say about collaboration, Academia intrinsically doesn't promote the right incentive structures to harbor collaboration. Let me explain, When you write a paper, the position of your name matters. If you are just a Ph.D. student and a first author to a paper, it's great. If you are an nth author Not so great. Apparently, this is a very touchy thing for academics. And lots of egos can clash around numbering and ordering of names.  I distinctly remember once attending some seminar in a lab and approaching a few students on research project ideas. The first thing that came out of the PhD student's mouth was the position in authorship. As an engineer who worked with teams in the past, this was never something I had thought about. Especially because I worked in industry, where it's always the group over the person. Academia is the reverse. Academia applauds the celebration of the individual's achievements. \n\nAll of this is understandable but it's something I don't like. This makes PhDs stick to their lane. The way citations/research-focus calibrate the \"hire-ability\" and \"completion of Ph.D. thesis\" metrics, people are incentivized to think about themselves instead of thinking about collaborations for making something better. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nA Ph.D. in its most idealistic sense for me is the pursuit of hard ideas(I am poetic that way). In a situation like now when you have to publish or perish and words on paper get passed off as science without even seeing the code that runs it, I am extremely discouraged to go down that route.  All these rants are not to diss on scientists. I did them because \"we\" as a community need better ways to addressing some of these problems.\n\n\nP.S.\nNever expected so many people to express their opinions about this rant. \n\nU shouldn’t take this seriously. As many people have stated I am an outsider with tiny experience to give a full picture.\n\nI realize that my post as coming out as something which tries to dichotomize academia and industry. I am not trying to do that. I wanted to highlight some problems I saw for which there is no one person to blame. These issues are in my opinion a byproduct of the economics which created this system. \n\nThank you for gold stranger.",

The incentives to disseminate ideas and to document work performance are not well aligned. Publishing has suffered as a result. It never used to be that important where you published for instance, whereas now it's critical — to the point that we collectively rely on an opaque, badly implemented \"publication quality index\" owned and run by a single private company that openly allows payment for placement.\n\n\nThe first point you make about top US universities only valuing the output — researchers or papers — from each other is on point. But I believe you overvalue the benefit of actually working at one of those universities.

It’s a translation system that can support over 200 languages, even if there isn't a lot of text available to learn from.   The reality is that a handful of languages dominate the web meaning only a fraction of the world can access content and contribute to the web in their own language. We want to change this by creating more inclusive machine translations systems – ones that unlock access to the web for the more than 4B people around the world that are currently excluded because they do not speak one of the few languages content is available in.   Here are a few things about NLLB we’re excited for:\n\n* Latest breakthrough: we created a single model that translates over 200 different languages with state-of-the-art results.\n* Billions of translations: We’re applying the techniques from the research advancements from NLLB to support more than 25 billion translations served every day on Facebook News Feed, Instagram, and our other platforms.\n* Meta’s AI Research SuperCluster (RSC): This large-scale conditional language model is one of the first AI models trained on Meta’s AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) supercomputer.\n* Open sourcing: By open sourcing our model and publishing a slew of research tools, we hope that AI researchers whose languages are not supported well or at all on commercial translations services could use our model to create support for that language. Furthermore, we’ve open sourced datasets, such as NLLB-Seed and FLORES-200 evaluation benchmark, which doubles the existing language coverage over our previous benchmark.\n* Wikimedia Foundation collaboration: We collaborated with the Wikimedia Foundation to help improve translation systems on their Content Translations tool. Editors can now more efficiently translate and edit articles in 20  low-resource languages, including 10 that previously were not supported by any machine translation tools on the platform. \n* Books translation: we’re partnering with local publishers around the world to translate children’s stories.\n\nYou can check out some of our materials and open sourced artifacts here: \n\n* Our latest blog post: [https://ai.facebook.com/blog/nllb-200-high-quality-machine-translation](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/nllb-200-high-quality-machine-translation)\n* Project Overview: [https://ai.facebook.com/research/no-language-left-behind/ ](https://ai.facebook.com/research/no-language-left-behind/ )\n* Product demo: [https://nllb.metademolab.com/](https://nllb.metademolab.com/)\n* Research paper: [https://research.facebook.com/publications/no-language-left-behind](https://research.facebook.com/publications/no-language-left-behind)\n* NLLB-200: [https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/nllb](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/nllb)\n* FLORES-200: [https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores)\n* LASER3: [https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER)  \n\nJoining us today for the AMA are:\n\n* Angela Fan (AF), Research Scientist \n* Jean Maillard (JM), Research Scientist\n* Maha Elbayad (ME), Research Scientist\n* Philipp Koehn (PK), Research Scientist\n* Shruti Bhosale (SB), Software Engineer  \n\nWe’ll be here from 07/21/2022 @09:00AM PT - 10:00AM PT \n\nThanks and we’re looking forward to answering your questions!\n\n**EDIT 10:30am PT:** Thanks for all the questions, we’re signing off!

All the **details are \"made up\".** This is similar to human quickly glancing a picture and trying to copy it by hand drawing. The large blobs are usually ok, but many details might be wrong. A bad example, suppose all training images are photos, then the compression won't work very well for line drawings, because the knowledge of line drawing is simply not in the trained model.\n2. The compressed images **cannot be reliably trusted**. They may look very realistic, but because many details might be made up, you cannot trust a word \"Zurich\" in the image is really \"Zurich\" but not \"Zürich\". In non-ML compression, you may see two faint dots above u, or the entire word is simple illegible, but I know it will not lie to me, it'll not make up a letter to fill it. (compression artifacts are very unnatural and easy to spot)\n3. **Standardization and distribution of the models**. In order to decode a compressed image, both sides have to share the same trained model, of exactly the same weights. The problem here is that model itself are normally big, which means everybody who wants to read the compressed images will have to download a 100MB model first. To make the matter even worst, if there is a new model v2.0 trained on more images, it has to be distributed to everybody who wants to decode new images compressed with v2.0. Unless there is a standardization organization taking care of the model authentication, versioning and distribution. Its application is restricted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore these 3 problems are solved, I'm cautiously optimistic about using it to speed up internet, as the other redditor mmspero hoped.",

            "description": "I have seen so many posts on social media about how great pytorch is and, in one latest tweet, 'boomers' use tensorflow ... It doesn't make sense to me and I see it as being incredibly powerful and widely used in research and industry. Should I be jumping ship? What is the actual difference and why is one favoured over the other? I have only used tensorflow and although I have been using it for a number of years now, still am learning. Should I be switching? Learning both? I'm not sure this post will answer my question but I would like to hear your honest opinion why you use one over the other or when you choose to use one instead of the other.\n\nEDIT: thank you all for your responses. I honestly did not expect to get this much information and I will definitely be taking a harder look at Pytorch and maybe trying it in my next project. For those of you in industry, do you see tensorflow used more or Pytorch in a production type implementation? My work uses tensorflow and I have heard it is used more outside of academia - mixed maybe at this point?\n\nEDIT2: I read through all the comments and here are my summaries and useful information to anyone new seeing this post or having the same question: \n\nTL;DR: People were so frustrated with TF 1.x that they switched to PT and never came back.\n\n* Python is 30 years old FYI \n* Apparently JAX is actually where the cool kids are … this is feeling like highschool again, always the wrong crowd. \n* Could use pytorch to develop then convert with ONNX to tensorflow for deployment \n* When we say TF we should really say tf.keras. I would not wish TF 1.x on my worst enemy. \n* Can use PT in Colab. PT is also definitely popular on Kaggle\n* There seems to be some indie kid rage where big brother google is not loved so TF is not loved. \n* TF 2.x with tf.keras and PT seem to now do similar things. However see below for some details. Neither seems perfect but I am now definitely looking at PT. Just looking at the installation and docs is a winner. As a still TF advocate (for the time being) I encourage you to check out TF 2.x - a lot of comments are related to TF 1.x Sessions etc.\n\nReasons for: \n\n* PT can feel laborious. With tf.keras it seems to be simpler and quicker, however also then lack of control. \n* Seems to still win the production argument \n* TF is now TF.Keras. Eager execution etc. has made it more align with PT \n* TF now has numpy implementation right in there. As well as gradient tape in for loop fashion making it actually really easy to manipulate tensors.\n* PT requires a custom training loop from the get go. Maybe TF 2.x easier then for beginners now and can be faster to get a quick and dirty implementation / transfer learning. \n* PT requires to specify the hardware too (?) You need to tell it which gpu to use? This was not mentioned but that is one feeling I had. \n* Tf.keras maybe more involved in industry because of short implementation time \n* Monitoring systems? Not really mentioned but I don't know what is out there for PT. eg TF dashboard, projector\n* PT needs precise handling of input output layer sizes. You have to know math.\n* How is PT on edge devices - is there tfLite equivalent? PT Mobile it seems\n\nReason for Pytorch or against TF:\n\n* Pythonic\n* Actually opensource\n* Steep learning curve for TF 1.x. Many people seem to have switched and never looked back on TF 2.x. Makes sense since everything is the same for PT since beginning\n* Easier implementation (it just works is a common comment)\n* Backward compatibility and framework changes in TF. RIP your 1.x code. Although I have heard there is a tool to auto convert to TF 2.x - never tried it though. I'm sure it fails unless your code is perfect. Pytorch is stable through and through.\n* Installation. 3000 series GPUs. I already have experience with this. I hate having to install TF on any new system. Looks like PT is easier and more compatible.\n* Academia is on PT kick. New students learning it as the first. Industry doesn't seem to care much as long as it works and any software devs can use it.\n* TF has an issue of many features / frameworks trying to be forced together, creating incompatibility issues. Too many ways to do one thing, not all of which will actually do what you need down the road. \n* Easier documentation - potentially. \n* The separation between what is in tf and tf.keras\n* Possible deprecation for Jax, although with all the hype I honestly see Jax maybe just becoming TF 3.x\n* Debug your model by accessing intermediate representations (Is this what MLIR in TF is now?)\n* Slow TF start-up\n* PyTorch has added support for ROCm 4.0 which is still in beta. You can now use AMD GPUs! WOW - that would be great, although I like the nvidia monopoly for my stocks!\n* Although tf.keras is now simple and quick, it may be oversimplified. PT seems to be a nice middle for any experimentation. \n\nFunny / excellent comments: \n\n* \"I'd rather be punched in the face than having to use TensorFlow ever again.\" \n* \" PyTorch == old-style Lego kits where they gave pretty generic blocks that you could combine to create whatever you want. TensorFlow == new-style Lego kits with a bunch of custom curved smooth blocks, that you can combine to create the exact picture on the box; but is awkward to build anything else. \n* On the possibility of dropping TF for Jax. \"So true, Google loves killing things: hangouts, Google plus, my job application..\" \n* \"I've been using PyTorch a few months now and I've never felt better. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. My eye sight has improved. - Andrej Karpathy (2017)\" \n* \"I feel like there is 'I gave up on TF and never looked back feel here'\"\n* \"I hated the clusterfuck of intertwined APIs of TF2.\" \n* \"…Pytorch had the advantage of being the second framework that could learn from the mistakes of Tensorflow - hence it's huge success.\" \n* \"Keras is the gateway drug of DL!\" \n* \"like anything Google related they seemed to put a lot of effort into making the docs extremely unreadable and incomplete\" \n* \"more practical imo, pytorch is - the yoda bot\" \n* \"Pytorch easy, tensorflow hard, me lazy, me dumb. Me like pytorch.\"",

DALL-E sits at 3.5B parameters, so there are even heavier models out there.\n*  Researchers at Google layered in a series of four GPU optimizations to enable Stable Diffusion 1.4 to run on a Samsung phone and generate images in under 12 seconds. RAM usage was also reduced heavily.\n* **Their breakthrough isn't device-specific; rather it's a generalized approach that can add improvements to all latent diffusion models.** Overall image generation time decreased by 52% and 33% on a Samsung S23 Ultra and an iPhone 14 Pro, respectively.\n*  Running generative AI locally on a phone, without a data connection or a cloud server, opens up a host of possibilities. This is just an example of how rapidly this space is moving as Stable Diffusion only just released last fall, and in its initial versions was slow to run on a hefty RTX 3080 desktop GPU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs small form-factor devices can run their own generative AI models, what does that mean for the future of computing? Some very exciting applications could be possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're curious, the paper (very technical) [can be accessed here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11267)",

            "description": "TD;LR: At Company A, Team X does advanced analytics using on-prem ERP tools and older programming languages. Their tools work very well and are designed based on very deep business and domain expertise. Team Y is a new and ambitious Data Science team that thinks they can replace Team X's tools with a bunch of R scripts and a custom built ML platform. Their models are simplistic, but more \"fashionable\" compared to the econometric models used by Team X, and team Y benefits from the ML/DS moniker so leadership is allowing Team Y to start a large scale overhaul of the analytics platform in question. Team Y doesn't have the experience for such a larger scale transformation, and is refusing to collaborate with team X. This project is very likely going to fail, and cause serious harm to the company as a whole financially and from a people perspective. I argue that this is not just because of bad leadership, but also because of various trends and mindsets in the DS community at large. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate (Jump to below the line for the original story): \n\nSeveral people in the comments are pointing out that this just a management failure, not something due to ML/DS, and that you can replace DS with any buzz tech and the story will still be relevant. \n\nMy response: \nOf course, any failure at an organization level is ultimately a management failure one way or the other. \nMoreover, it is also the case that ML/DS when done correctly, will always improve a company's bottom line. There is no scenario where the proper ML solution, delivered at a reasonable cost and in a timely fashion, will somehow hurt the company's bottom line.\n\nMy point is that in this case management is failing because of certain trends and practices that are specific to the ML/DS community, namely: \n* The idea that DS teams should operate independently of tech and business orgs -- too much autonomy for DS teams \n* The disregard for domain knowledge that seems prevalent nowadays  thanks to the ML hype, that DS can be generalists and someone with good enough ML chops can solve any business problem.  That wasn't the case when I first left academia for the industry in 2009  (back then nobody would even bother with a phone screen if you didn't have the right domain knowledge). \n* Over reliance on resources who check all the ML hype related boxes (knows Python, R, Tensorflow, Shiny, etc..., has the right Coursera certifications, has blogged on the topic, etc...), but are lacking in depth of  experience. DS interviews nowadays all seem to be: Can you tell me what a p-value is? What is elastic net regression? Show me how to fit a model in sklearn? How do you impute NAs in an R dataframe? Any smart person can look those up on Stackoverflow or Cross-Validated,.....Instead teams should be asking stuff like: why does portfolio optimization use QP not LP? How does a forecast influence a customer service level? When should a recommendation engine be content based and when should it use collaborative filtering? etc...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(This is a true story, happening to the company I currently work for. Names, domains, algorithms, and roles have been shuffled around to protect my anonymity)* \n\nCompany A has been around for several decades. It is not the biggest name in its domain, but it is a well respected one. Risk analysis and portfolio optimization have been a core of Company A's business since the 90s. They have a large team of 30 or so analysts who perform those tasks on a daily basis. These analysts use ERP solutions implemented for them by one the big ERP companies (SAP, Teradata, Oracle, JD Edwards,...) or one of the major tech consulting companies (Deloitte, Accenture, PWC, Capgemini, etc...) in collaboration with their own in house engineering team. The tools used are embarrassingly old school: Classic RDBMS running on on-prem servers or maybe even on mainframes, code written in COBOL, Fortran, weird proprietary stuff like ABAP or SPSS.....you get the picture. But the models and analytic functions were pretty sophisticated, and surprisingly cutting edge compared to the published academic literature. Most of all, they fit well with the company's enterprise ecosystem, and were honed based on years of deep domain knowledge. \n\nThey have a tech team of several engineers (poached from the aforementioned software and consulting companies) and product managers (who came from the experienced pools of analysts and managers who use the software, or poached from business rivals) maintaining and running this software. Their technology might be old school, but collectively, they know the domain and the company's overall architecture very, very well. They've guided the company through several large scale upgrades and migrations and they have a track record of delivering on time, without too much overhead. The few times they've stumbled, they knew how to pick themselves up very quickly. In fact within their industry niche, they have a reputation for their expertise, and have very good relations with the various vendors they've had to deal with. They were the launching pad of several successful ERP consulting careers. \n\nInterestingly, despite dealing on a daily basis with statistical modeling and optimization algorithms, none of the analysts, engineers, or product managers involved describe themselves as data scientists or machine learning experts. It is mostly a cultural thing: Their expertise predates the Data Science/ML hype that started circa 2010, and they got most of their chops using proprietary enterprise tools instead of the open source tools popular nowadays. A few of them have formal statistical training, but most of them came from engineering or domain backgrounds and learned stats on the fly while doing their job. Call this team \"Team X\". \n\nSometime around the mid 2010s, Company A started having some serious anxiety issues: Although still doing very well for a company its size, overall economic and demographic trends were shrinking its customer base, and a couple of so called disruptors came up with a new app and business model that started seriously eating into their revenue. A suitable reaction to appease shareholders and Wall Street was necessary. The company already had a decent website and a pretty snazzy app, what more could be done? Leadership decided that it was high time that AI and ML become a core part of the company's business. An ambitious Manager, with no science or engineering background, but who had very briefly toyed with a recommender system a couple of years back, was chosen to build a data science team, call it team \"Y\" (he had a bachelor's in history from the local state college and worked for several years in the company's marketing org). Team \"Y\" consists mostly of internal hires who decided they wanted to be data scientists and completed a Coursera certification or a Galvanize boot camp, before being brought on to the team, along with a few of fresh Ph.D or M.Sc holders who didn't like academia and wanted to try their hand at an industry role. All of them were very bright people, they could write great Medium blog posts and give inspiring TED talks, but collectively they had very little real world industry experience. \n\nAs is the fashion nowadays, this group was made part of a data science org that reported directly to the CEO and Board, bypassing the CIO and any tech or business VPs, since Company A wanted to claim the monikers \"data driven\" and \"AI powered\" in their upcoming shareholder meetings. In 3 or 4 years of existence, team Y produced a few Python and R scripts. Their architectural experience  consisted almost entirely in connecting Flask to S3 buckets or Redshift tables, with a couple of the more resourceful ones learning how to plug their models into Tableau or how to spin up a Kuberneties pod.  But they needn't worry: The aforementioned manager, who was now a director (and was also doing an online Masters to make up for his qualifications gap and bolster his chances of becoming VP soon - at least he now understands what L1 regularization is), was a master at playing corporate politics and self-promotion. No matter how few actionable insights team Y produced or how little code they deployed to production, he always had their back and made sure they had ample funding. In fact he now had grandiose plans for setting up an all-purpose machine learning platform that can be used to solve all of the company's data problems. \n\nA couple of sharp minded members of team Y, upon googling their industry name along with the word \"data science\", realized that risk analysis was a prime candidate for being solved with Bayesian models, and there was already a nifty R package for doing just that, whose tutorial they went through on R-Bloggers.com. One of them had even submitted a Bayesian classifier Kernel for a competition on Kaggle (he was 203rd on the leaderboard), and was eager to put his new-found expertise to use on a real world problem. They pitched the idea to their director, who saw a perfect use case for his upcoming ML platform. They started work on it immediately, without bothering to check whether anybody at Company A was already doing risk analysis. Since their org was independent, they didn't really need to check with anybody else before they got funding for their initiative. Although it was basically a Naive Bayes classifier, the term ML was added to the project tile, to impress the board. \n\nAs they progressed with their work however, tensions started to build. They had asked the data warehousing and CA analytics teams to build pipelines for them, and word eventually got out to team X about their project. Team X was initially thrilled: They offered to collaborate whole heartedly, and would have loved to add an ML based feather to their already impressive cap. The product owners and analysts were totally onboard as well: They saw a chance to get in on the whole Data Science hype that they kept hearing about. But through some weird mix of arrogance and insecurity, team Y refused to collaborate with them or share any of their long term goals with them, even as they went to other parts of the company giving brown bag presentations and tutorials on the new model they created. \n\nTeam X got resentful: from what they saw of team Y's model, their approach was hopelessly naive and had little chances of scaling or being sustainable in production, and they knew exactly how to help with that. Deploying the model to production would have taken them a few days, given how comfortable they were with DevOps and continuous delivery (team Y had taken several months to figure out how to deploy a simple R script to production). And despite how old school their own tech was, team X were crafty enough to be able to plug it in to their existing architecture. Moreover, the output of the model was such that it didn't take into account how the business will consume it or how it was going to be fed to downstream systems, and the product owners could have gone a long way in making the model more amenable to adoption by the business stakeholders. But team Y wouldn't listen, and their leads brushed off any attempts at communication, let alone collaboration. The vibe that team Y was giving off was \"We are the cutting edge ML team, you guys are the legacy server grunts. We don't need your opinion.\", and they seemed to have a complete disregard for domain knowledge, or worse, they thought that all that domain knowledge consisted of was being able to grasp the definitions of a few business metrics. \n\nTeam X got frustrated and tried to express their concerns to leadership. But despite owning a vital link in Company A's business process, they were only \\~50 people in a large 1000 strong technology and operations org, and they were several layers removed from the C-suite, so it was impossible for them to get their voices heard. \n\nMeanwhile, the unstoppable director was doing what he did best: Playing corporate politics. Despite how little his team had actually delivered, he had convinced the board that all analysis and optimization tasks should now be migrated to his yet to be delivered ML platform. Since most leaders now knew that there was overlap between team Y and team X's objectives, his pitch was no longer that team Y was going to create a new insight, but that they were going to replace (or modernize) the legacy statistics based on-prem tools with more accurate cloud based ML tools. Never mind that there was no support in the academic literature for the idea that Naive Bayes works better than the Econometric approaches used by team X, let alone the additional wacky idea that Bayesian Optimization would definitely outperform the QP solvers that were running in production. \n\nUnbeknownst to team X, the original Bayesian risk analysis project has now grown into a multimillion dollar major overhaul initiative, which included the eventual replacement of all of the tools and functions supported by team X along with the necessary migration to the cloud. The CIO and a couple of business VPs are on now board, and tech leadership is treating it as a done deal.\n\nAn outside vendor, a startup who nobody had heard of, was contracted to help build the platform, since team Y has no engineering skills. The choice was deliberate, as calling on any of the established consulting or software companies would have eventually led leadership to the conclusion that team X was better suited for a transformation on this scale than team Y. \n\nTeam Y has no experience with any major ERP deployments, and no domain knowledge, yet they are being tasked with fundamentally changing the business process that is at the core of Company A's business. Their models actually perform worse than those deployed by team X, and their architecture is hopelessly simplistic, compared to what is necessary for running such a solution in production. \n\nIronically, using Bayesian thinking and based on all the evidence, the likelihood that team Y succeeds is close to 0%. \n\nAt best, the project is going to end up being a write off of 50 million dollars or more. Once the !@#$!@# hits the fan, a couple of executive heads are going to role, and dozens of people will get laid off.\n\nAt worst, given how vital risk analysis and portfolio optimization is to Company A's revenue stream, the failure will eventually sink the whole company. It probably won't go bankrupt, but it will lose a significant portion of its business and work force. Failed ERP implementations can and do sink large companies: Just see what happened to National Grid US, SuperValu or Target Canada. \n\nOne might argue that this is more about corporate disfunction and bad leadership than about data science and AI. \n\nBut I disagree. I think the core driver of this debacle is indeed the blind faith in Data Scientists, ML models and the promise of AI, and the overall culture of hype and self promotion that is very common among the ML crowd. \n\nWe haven't seen the end of this story: I sincerely hope that this ends well for the sake of my colleagues and all involved. Company A is a good company, and both its customers and its employees deserver better. But the chances of that happening are negligible given all the information available, and this failure will hit my company hard. ",

There are a few companies that get it right and a handful of startups that seem to understand what they are doing, but something like 80% of companies I've encountered are just throwing darts at a board.\n\nNo different than the late 90's when people thought every Internet business should be worth 100 times its revenues and was going to experience 30%+ annual growth for 3 decades.\n\nData science can really add major value to organizations that use it right, but unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately for some innovative startups looking to shake things up), most companies don't really understand what they are doing. They think they can just grab any random 28 year old Statistics PhD, call him \"Director of Data Science\" and everything will magically work out.\n\nI've seen people with decades of experience and expertise with data simply being dismissed because their job title wasn't \"Data Scientist\". And too many people think \"Data Science\" is just one giant skill, rather than hundreds of little skills, so someone called \"Data Scientist\" for 5 years could have significantly less \"data science\" experience than someone with some other job titles for 15 years.\n\nWe'll probably get the data science backlash in a few years as companies realize they're wasting money, but they'll blame \"data science\" rather than their own poor leadership decisions.",

The other leads are a true DS stats/econ PhD with 10+ years of business experience and a true full stack with 15+ years of lead developer/systems administrator experience. We successfully deploy everything from custom deep learning python solutions to simple linear solutions written entirely in SQL. Our lead DS always goes with the right algorithm for the job regardless of how cool it is.

No team should be allowed to produce nothing for long periods and competent management would ensure that.

What did I miss? What did I get wrong?\n\nThe methods – roughly sorted from largest to smallest expected speed-up – are:\n\n1. Consider using a different learning rate schedule.\n2. Use multiple workers and pinned memory in DataLoader.\n3. Max out the batch size.\n4. Use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP).\n5. Consider using a different optimizer.\n6. Turn on cudNN benchmarking.\n7. Beware of frequently transferring data between CPUs and GPUs.\n8. Use gradient/activation checkpointing.\n9. Use gradient accumulation.\n10.

Use gradient clipping.\n15. Turn off bias before BatchNorm.\n16. Turn off gradient computation during validation.\n17. Use input and batch normalization.\n\n## 1. Consider using another learning rate schedule\n\nThe learning rate (schedule) you choose has a large impact on the speed of convergence as well as the generalization performance of your model.\n\nCyclical Learning Rates and the 1Cycle learning rate schedule are both methods introduced by Leslie N. Smith ([here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120)), and then popularised by fast.ai's Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger ([here](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/) and [here](https://github.com/sgugger/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Cyclical%20LR%20and%20momentums.ipynb)). Essentially, the 1Cycle learning rate schedule looks something like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sc37u5knmxa61.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=09b309b4dbd67eedb4ab5f86e03e0e83d7b072d1\n\nSylvain writes:\n\n>\\[1cycle consists of\\]  two steps of equal lengths, one going from a lower learning rate to a higher one than go back to the minimum. The maximum should be the value picked with the Learning Rate Finder, and the lower one can be ten times lower. Then, the length of this cycle should be slightly less than the total number of epochs, and, in the last part of training, we should allow the learning rate to decrease more than the minimum, by several orders of magnitude.\n\nIn the best case this schedule achieves a massive speed-up – what Smith calls *Superconvergence* – as compared to conventional learning rate schedules. Using the 1Cycle policy he needs \\~10x fewer training iterations of a ResNet-56 on ImageNet to match the performance of the original paper, for instance). The schedule seems to perform robustly well across common architectures and optimizers.\n\nPyTorch implements both of these methods `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CyclicLR` and `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR,` see [the documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html).\n\nOne drawback of these schedulers is that they introduce a number of additional hyperparameters. [This post](https://towardsdatascience.com/hyper-parameter-tuning-techniques-in-deep-learning-4dad592c63c8) and [this repo](https://github.com/davidtvs/pytorch-lr-finder), offer a nice overview and implementation of how good hyper-parameters can be found including the Learning Rate Finder mentioned above.\n\nWhy does this work? It doesn't seem entirely clear but one[ possible explanation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) might be that regularly increasing the learning rate helps to traverse [saddle points in the loss landscape ](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/430c3626b879b4005d41b8a46172e0c0-Paper.pdf)more quickly.\n\n## 2. Use multiple workers and pinned memory in DataLoader\n\nWhen using [torch.utils.data.DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader), set `num_workers > 0`, rather than the default value of 0, and `pin_memory=True`, rather than the default value of False. Details of this are [explained here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html).\n\n[Szymon Micacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) achieves a 2x speed-up for a single training epoch by using four workers and pinned memory.\n\nA rule of thumb that [people are using ](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/guidelines-for-assigning-num-workers-to-dataloader/813/5)to choose the number of workers is to set it to four times the number of available GPUs with both a larger and smaller number of workers leading to a slow down.\n\nNote that increasing num\\_workerswill increase your CPU memory consumption.\n\n## 3. Max out the batch size\n\nThis is a somewhat contentious point. Generally, however, it seems like using the largest batch size your GPU memory permits will accelerate your training (see [NVIDIA's Szymon Migacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf), for instance). Note that you will also have to adjust other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, if you modify the batch size. A rule of thumb here is to double the learning rate as you double the batch size.\n\n[OpenAI has a nice empirical paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06162.pdf) on the number of convergence steps needed for different batch sizes. [Daniel Huynh](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-a-batch-size-finder-in-fastai-how-to-get-a-4x-speedup-with-better-generalization-813d686f6bdf) runs some experiments with different batch sizes (also using the 1Cycle policy discussed above) where he achieves a 4x speed-up by going from batch size 64 to 512.\n\n[One of the downsides](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04836.pdf) of using large batch sizes, however, is that they might lead to solutions that generalize worse than those trained with smaller batches.\n\n## 4. Use Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)\n\nThe release of PyTorch 1.6 included a native implementation of Automatic Mixed Precision training to PyTorch. The main idea here is that certain operations can be run faster and without a loss of accuracy at semi-precision (FP16) rather than in the single-precision (FP32) used elsewhere. AMP, then, automatically decide which operation should be executed in which format. This allows both for faster training and a smaller memory footprint.\n\nIn the best case, the usage of AMP would look something like this:\n\n    import torch\n    # Creates once at the beginning of training\n    scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()\n    \n    for data, label in data_iter:\n       optimizer.zero_grad()\n       # Casts operations to mixed precision\n       with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():\n          loss = model(data)\n    \n       # Scales the loss, and calls backward()\n       # to create scaled gradients\n       scaler.scale(loss).backward()\n    \n       # Unscales gradients and calls\n       # or skips optimizer.step()\n       scaler.step(optimizer)\n    \n       # Updates the scale for next iteration\n       scaler.update()\n\nBenchmarking a number of common language and vision models on NVIDIA V100 GPUs, [Huang and colleagues find](https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-training-on-nvidia-gpus-with-pytorch-automatic-mixed-precision/) that using AMP over regular FP32 training yields roughly 2x – but upto 5.5x – training speed-ups.\n\nCurrently, only CUDA ops can be autocast in this way. See the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html#op-eligibility) here for more details on this and other limitations.\n\nu/SVPERBlA points out that you can squeeze out some additional performance (\\~ 20%) from AMP on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs if you convert your tensors to the [Channels Last memory format](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/memory_format_tutorial.html). Refer to [this section](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-convolutional/index.html#tensor-layout) in the NVIDIA docs for an explanation of the speedup and more about NCHW versus NHWC tensor formats.\n\n## 5. Consider using another optimizer\n\nAdamW is Adam with weight decay (rather than L2-regularization) which was popularized by fast.ai and is now available natively in PyTorch as `torch.optim.AdamW`. AdamW seems to consistently outperform Adam in terms of both the error achieved and the training time. See [this excellent blog](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/) post on why using weight decay instead of L2-regularization makes a difference for Adam.\n\nBoth Adam and AdamW work well with the 1Cycle policy described above.\n\nThere are also a few not-yet-native optimizers that have received a lot of attention recently, most notably LARS ([pip installable implementation](https://github.com/kakaobrain/torchlars)) and [LAMB](https://github.com/cybertronai/pytorch-lamb).\n\nNVIDA's APEX implements fused versions of a number of common optimizers such as [Adam](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/optimizers.html). This implementation avoid a number of passes to and from GPU memory as compared to the PyTorch implementation of Adam, yielding speed-ups in the range of 5%.\n\n## 6. Turn on cudNN benchmarking\n\nIf your model architecture remains fixed and your input size stays constant, setting `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True` might be beneficial ([docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/backends.html#torch-backends-cudnn)). This enables the cudNN autotuner which will benchmark a number of different ways of computing convolutions in cudNN and then use the fastest method from then on.\n\nFor a rough reference on the type of speed-up you can expect from this, [Szymon Migacz](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) achieves a speed-up of 70% on a forward pass for a convolution and a 27% speed-up for a forward + backward pass of the same convolution.\n\nOne caveat here is that this autotuning might become very slow if you max out the batch size as mentioned above.\n\n## 7. Beware of frequently transferring data between CPUs and GPUs\n\nBeware of frequently transferring tensors from a GPU to a CPU using `tensor.cpu()` and vice versa using `tensor.cuda()` as these are relatively expensive. The same applies for `.item()` and `.numpy()` – use `.detach()` instead.\n\nIf you are creating a new tensor, you can also directly assign it to your GPU using the keyword argument `device=torch.device('cuda:0')`.\n\nIf you do need to transfer data, using `.to(non_blocking=True)`, might be useful [as long as you don't have any synchronization points](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/should-we-set-non-blocking-to-true/38234/4) after the transfer.\n\nIf you really have to, you might want to give Santosh Gupta's [SpeedTorch](https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/SpeedTorch) a try, although it doesn't seem entirely clear when this actually does/doesn't provide speed-ups.\n\n## 8. Use gradient/activation checkpointing\n\nQuoting directly from the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html):\n\n>Checkpointing works by trading compute for memory. Rather than storing all intermediate activations of the entire computation graph for computing backward, the checkpointed part does **not** save intermediate activations, and instead recomputes them in backward pass. It can be applied on any part of a model.  \n>  \n>Specifically, in the forward pass, function will run in [torch.no\\_grad()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.no_grad.html#torch.no_grad) manner, i.e., not storing the intermediate activations. Instead, the forward pass saves the inputs tuple and the functionparameter. In the backwards pass, the saved inputs and function is retrieved, and the forward pass is computed on function again, now tracking the intermediate activations, and then the gradients are calculated using these activation values.\n\nSo while this will might slightly increase your run time for a given batch size, you'll significantly reduce your memory footprint. This in turn will allow you to further increase the batch size you're using allowing for better GPU utilization.\n\nWhile checkpointing is implemented natively as `torch.utils.checkpoint`([docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/checkpoint.html)), it does seem to take some thought and effort to implement properly. Priya Goyal [has a good tutorial ](https://github.com/prigoyal/pytorch_memonger/blob/master/tutorial/Checkpointing_for_PyTorch_models.ipynb)demonstrating some of the key aspects of checkpointing.\n\n## 9. Use gradient accumulation\n\nAnother approach to increasing the batch size is to accumulate gradients across multiple `.backward()` passes before calling optimizer.step().\n\nFollowing [a post](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) by Hugging Face's Thomas Wolf, gradient accumulation can be implemented as follows:\n\n    model.zero_grad()                                   # Reset gradients tensors\n    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(training_set):\n        predictions = model(inputs)                     # Forward pass\n        loss = loss_function(predictions, labels)       # Compute loss function\n        loss = loss / accumulation_steps                # Normalize our loss (if averaged)\n        loss.backward()                                 # Backward pass\n        if (i+1) % accumulation_steps == 0:             # Wait for several backward steps\n            optimizer.step()                            # Now we can do an optimizer step\n            model.zero_grad()                           # Reset gradients tensors\n            if (i+1) % evaluation_steps == 0:           # Evaluate the model when we...\n                evaluate_model()                        # ...have no gradients accumulate\n\nThis method was developed mainly to circumvent GPU memory limitations and I'm not entirely clear on the trade-off between having additional `.backward()` loops. [This discussion](https://forums.fast.ai/t/accumulating-gradients/33219/28) on the fastai forum seems to suggest that it can in fact accelerate training, so it's probably worth a try.\n\n## 10. Use Distributed Data Parallel for multi-GPU training\n\nMethods to accelerate distributed training probably warrant their own post but one simple one is to use `torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel` rather than `torch.nn.DataParallel`. By doing so, each GPU will be driven by a dedicated CPU core avoiding the GIL issues of DataParallel.\n\nIn general, I can strongly recommend reading the [documentation on distributed training.](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html)\n\n## 11. Set gradients to None rather than 0\n\nUse `.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)` rather than `.zero_grad()`.\n\nDoing so will let the memory allocator handle the gradients rather than actively setting them to 0. This will lead to yield a *modest* speed-up as they say in the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html), so don't expect any miracles.\n\nWatch out, doing this is not side-effect free! Check the docs for the details on this.\n\n## 12. Use .as_tensor() rather than .tensor()\n\n`torch.tensor()` always copies data. If you have a numpy array that you want to convert, use `torch.as_tensor()` or `torch.from_numpy()` to avoid copying the data.\n\n## 13. Turn on debugging tools only when actually needed\n\nPyTorch offers a number of useful debugging tools like the [autograd.profiler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#profiler), [autograd.grad\\_check](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#numerical-gradient-checking), and [autograd.anomaly\\_detection](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#anomaly-detection). Make sure to use them to better understand when needed but to also turn them off when you don't need them as they will slow down your training.\n\n## 14. Use gradient clipping\n\nOriginally used to avoid exploding gradients in RNNs, there is both some [empirical evidence as well as some theoretical support](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJgnXpVYwS) that clipping gradients (roughly speaking: `gradient = min(gradient, threshold)`) accelerates convergence.\n\nHugging Face's [Transformer implementation](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/7729ef738161a0a182b172fcb7c351f6d2b9c50d/examples/run_squad.py#L156) is a really clean example of how to use gradient clipping as well as some of the other methods such as AMP mentioned in this post.\n\nIn PyTorch this can be done using `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_`([documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html#torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_)).\n\nIt's not entirely clear to me which models benefit how much from gradient clipping but it seems to be robustly useful for RNNs, Transformer-based and ResNets architectures and a range of different optimizers.\n\n## 15. Turn off bias before BatchNorm\n\nThis is a very simple one: turn off the bias of layers before BatchNormalization layers. For a 2-D convolutional layer, this can be done by setting the bias keyword to False: `torch.nn.Conv2d(..., bias=False, ...)`.  (Here's a r[eminder why this makes sense](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46256747/can-not-use-both-bias-and-batch-normalization-in-convolution-layers).)\n\nYou will save some parameters, I would however expect the speed-up of this to be relatively small as compared to some of the other methods mentioned here.\n\n## 16. Turn off gradient computation during validation\n\nThis one is straightforward: set `torch.no_grad()` during validation.\n\n## 17. Use input and batch normalization\n\nYou're probably already doing this but you might want to double-check:\n\n* Are you [normalizing](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html) your input?\n* Are you using [batch-normalization](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html)?\n\nAnd [here's](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/437840/in-machine-learning-how-does-normalization-help-in-convergence-of-gradient-desc) a reminder of why you probably should.\n\n### Bonus tip from the comments: Use JIT to fuse point-wise operations.\n\nIf you have adjacent point-wise operations you can use [PyTorch JIT](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#creating-torchscript-code) to combine them into one FusionGroup which can then be launched on a single kernel rather than multiple kernels as would have been done per default. You'll also save some memory reads and writes.\n\n[Szymon Migacz shows](https://nvlabs.github.io/eccv2020-mixed-precision-tutorial/files/szymon_migacz-pytorch-performance-tuning-guide.pdf) how you can use the `@torch.jit.script` decorator to fuse the operations in a GELU, for instance:\n\n    @torch.jit.script\n    def fused_gelu(x):\n        return x * 0.5 * (1.0 + torch.erf(x / 1.41421))\n\nIn this case, fusing the operations leads to a 5x speed-up for the execution of `fused_gelu`  \nas compared to the unfused version.\n\nSee also [this post](https://pytorch.org/blog/optimizing-cuda-rnn-with-torchscript/) for an example of how Torchscript can be used to accelerate an RNN.\n\nHat tip to u/Patient_Atmosphere45 for the suggestion.\b\n\n## Sources and additional resources\n\nMany of the tips listed above come from Szymon Migacz' [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mS1fIYj1So) and post in the [PyTorch docs](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tuning_guide.html).\n\nPyTorch Lightning's William Falcon has [two](https://towardsdatascience.com/9-tips-for-training-lightning-fast-neural-networks-in-pytorch-8e63a502f565) [interesting](https://towardsdatascience.com/7-tips-for-squeezing-maximum-performance-from-pytorch-ca4a40951259) posts with tips to speed-up training. [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) does already take care of some of the points above per-default.\n\nThomas Wolf at Hugging Face has a [number](https://medium.com/@Thomwolf) of interesting articles on accelerating deep learning – with a particular focus on language models.\n\nThe same goes for [Sylvain Gugger](https://sgugger.github.io/category/basics.html) and [Jeremy Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqGTFqPEXWs): they have many interesting posts in particular on [learning](https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html) [rates](https://sgugger.github.io/how-do-you-find-a-good-learning-rate.html) and [AdamW](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/).\n\n*Thanks to Ben Hahn, Kevin Klein and Robin Vaaler for their feedback on a draft of this post!*\n\n**I've also put all of the above into this** [**blog post**](https://efficientdl.com/faster-deep-learning-in-pytorch-a-guide/)**.**",

            "description": "*Recently, I saw a [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/stand-up-for-best-practices-8a8433d3e0e8) by [Rajiv Shah](https://twitter.com/rajcs4), Chicago-based data-scientist, regarding an article published in Nature last year called [Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y), written by scientists at Harvard in collaboration with Google. Below is the article:*\n\n**Stand Up for Best Practices:\nMisuse of Deep Learning in Nature’s Earthquake Aftershock Paper**\n\n**The Dangers of Machine Learning Hype**\n\nPractitioners of AI, machine learning, predictive modeling, and data science have grown enormously over the last few years. What was once a niche field defined by its blend of knowledge is becoming a rapidly growing profession. As the excitement around AI continues to grow, the new wave of ML augmentation, automation, and GUI tools will lead to even more growth in the number of people trying to build predictive models.\n\nBut here’s the rub: While it becomes easier to use the tools of predictive modeling, predictive modeling knowledge is not yet a widespread commodity. Errors can be counterintuitive and subtle, and they can easily lead you to the wrong conclusions if you’re not careful.\n\nI’m a data scientist who works with dozens of expert data science teams for a living. In my day job, I see these teams striving to build high-quality models. The best teams work together to review their models to detect problems. There are many hard-to-detect-ways that lead to problematic models (say, by allowing target leakage into their training data).\n\nIdentifying issues is not fun. This requires admitting that exciting results are “too good to be true” or that their methods were not the right approach. In other words, *it’s less about the sexy data science hype that gets headlines and more about a rigorous scientific discipline.*\n\n**Bad Methods Create Bad Results**\n\nAlmost a year ago, I read an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y) in Nature that claimed unprecedented accuracy in predicting earthquake aftershocks by using deep learning. Reading the article, my internal radar became deeply suspicious of their results. *Their methods simply didn’t carry many of the hallmarks of careful predicting modeling.*\n\nI started to dig deeper. In the meantime, this article blew up and became [widely recognized](https://blog.google/technology/ai/forecasting-earthquake-aftershock-locations-ai-assisted-science/)! It was even included in the [release notes](https://medium.com/tensorflow/whats-coming-in-tensorflow-2-0-d3663832e9b8) for Tensorflow as an example of what deep learning could do. However, in my digging, I found major flaws in the paper. Namely, data leakage which leads to unrealistic accuracy scores and a lack of attention to model selection (you don’t build a 6 layer neural network when a simpler model provides the same level of accuracy).\n\nTo my earlier point: these are subtle, but *incredibly basic* predictive modeling errors that can invalidate the entire results of an experiment. Data scientists are trained to recognize and avoid these issues in their work. I assumed that this was simply overlooked by the author, so I contacted her and let her know so that she could improve her analysis. Although we had previously communicated, she did not respond to my email over concerns with the paper.\n\n**Falling On Deaf Ears**\n\nSo, what was I to do? My coworkers told me to just [tweet](https://twitter.com/rajcs4/status/1143236424738775046) [it](https://twitter.com/DataScienceLA/status/1143245342785228800) and let it go, but I wanted to stand up for good modeling practices. I thought reason and best practices would prevail, so I started a 6-month process of writing up my results and shared them with Nature.\nUpon sharing my results, I received a note from Nature in January 2019 that despite serious concerns about data leakage and model selection that invalidate their experiment, they saw no need to correct the errors, because “**Devries et al. are concerned primarily with using machine learning as [a] tool to extract insight into the natural world, and not with details of the algorithm design**.” The authors provided a much [harsher](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues/blob/master/correspondence/Authors_DeVries_Response.pdf) response.\n\nYou can read the entire exchange on my [github](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues).\n\nIt’s not enough to say that I was disappointed. This was a major paper (it’s **Nature**!) that bought into AI hype and published a paper despite it using flawed methods.\n\nThen, just this week, I ran [across](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20521-8_1) [articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01983) by Arnaud Mignan and Marco Broccardo on shortcomings that they found in the aftershocks article. Here are two more data scientists with expertise in earthquake analysis who also noticed flaws in the paper. I also have placed my analysis and reproducible code on [github](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues).\n\n**Standing Up For Predictive Modeling Methods**\n\nI want to make it clear: my goal is not to villainize the authors of the aftershocks paper. I don’t believe that they were malicious, and I think that they would argue their goal was to just show how machine learning could be applied to aftershocks. Devries is an accomplished earthquake scientist who wanted to use the latest methods for her field of study and found exciting results from it.\n\nBut here’s the problem: their insights and results were based on fundamentally flawed methods. It’s not enough to say, “This isn’t a machine learning paper, it’s an earthquake paper.” If you use predictive modeling, then the quality of your results are determined by the quality of your modeling. Your work becomes data science work, and you are on the hook for your scientific rigor.\n\nThere is a huge appetite for papers that use the latest technologies and approaches. It becomes very difficult to push back on these papers.\n\nBut if we allow papers or projects with fundamental issues to advance, it hurts all of us. It undermines the field of predictive modeling.\n\nPlease push back on bad data science. Report bad findings to papers. And if they don’t take action, go to twitter, post about it, share your results and make noise. This type of collective action worked to raise awareness of p-values and combat the epidemic of p-hacking. We need good machine learning practices if we want our field to continue to grow and maintain credibility.\n\n[Link to Rajiv's Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/stand-up-for-best-practices-8a8433d3e0e8)\n\n[Original Nature Publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0438-y) (note: paywalled)\n\n[GitHub repo contains an attempt to reproduce Nature's paper](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues)\n\n[Confrontational correspondence with authors](https://github.com/rajshah4/aftershocks_issues/blob/master/correspondence/Authors_DeVries_Response.pdf)",

That specific issue doesn't invalidate the paper, it would be something that would be more suited to a separate article, exactly like what Mignan and Broccardo have done. \n\nNonetheless, the argument of the paper as laid out in the authors' response is confusing - their argument seems to be that the maximum change in shear stress and von-Mises yield criterion are useful quantities because a neural network gives the same accuracy as them. If the AUC scores for these non-ML based methods are only interpretable relative to the neural network, then it's important for the neural network to be implemented correctly. On the other hand, if the purpose is as the referee states\n\n> Instead, the paper showed that a relatively simple, but purely data-driven approach could predict aftershock locations better than Coulomb stress (the metric used in most studies to date) and also identify stress-based proxies (max shear stress, von Mises stress) that have physical significance and are better predictors than the classical Coulomb stress. In this way, the deep learning algorithm was used as a tool to remove our human bias toward the Coulomb stress criterion, which has been ingrained in our psyche by more than 20 years of published literature.\n\nthen one could simply compare the AUC scores for max shear stress and von Mises stress to Coulomb stress and conclude that they were better predictors, without involving a neural network at all. In that respect, it doesn't matter one bit what the neural network does, and that seems to be the main reason for the responses being what they are. Personally, I don't understand the fascination with publishing neural network results like these, but they _do_ seem to be of interest to specific research communities (not just earthquakes, in many other domains too) and the relevance of the results is left to the journal and the reviewers, and isn't something that would warrant publishing amendments for. \n\nOverall, I think it would have been more useful for Shah to \n\na) Clearly indicate the amendments that should be made to this work e.g. updating the AUC and explained variance values in the paper\nb) Write up his broader critique and post it on arXiv or similar\n\nBut lastly, one thing my PhD supervisor often liked to point out is that top journals like Nature and Science have a relatively high rate of publishing results that later can't be reproduced or are found to be flawed in some way. They may be the most prestigious journals, that doesn't actually mean they are the most scientifically rigorous",

            "description": "I have a confession to make.\n\nI was a CS major in college and took very few advanced math or stats courses. Besides basic calculus, linear algebra, and probability 101, I took only one machine learning class. It was about very specific SVMs/decision tree/probabilistic graphical models that I rarely encounter today.\n\nI joined a machine learning lab in college and was mentored by a senior PhD. We actually had a couple of publications together, though they were nothing but minor architecture changes. Now that I’m in grad school doing AI research full-time, I thought I could continue to get away with zero math and clever lego building. Unfortunately, I fail to produce anything creative. What’s worse, I find it increasingly hard to read some of the latest papers, which probably don’t look complicated at all to math-minded students. The gap in my math/stats knowledge is taking a hefty toll on my career.\n\nFor example, I’ve never heard of the term “Lipschitz” or “Wasserstein distance” before, so I’m unable to digest the Wasserstein GAN paper, let alone invent something like that by myself. Same with f-GAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00709.pdf), and SeLU (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515.pdf). I don’t have the slightest clue what the 100-page SeLU proof is doing. The “Normalizing Flow” (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05770.pdf) paper even involves physics (Langevin Flow, stochastic differential equation) … each term seems to require a semester-long course to master. I don’t even know where to start wrapping my head around. \n\nI’ve thought about potential solutions. The top-down approach is to google each unfamiliar jargon in the paper. That doesn’t work at all because the explanation of 1 unknown points to 3 more unknowns. It’s an exponential tree expansion. The alternative bottom-up approach is to read real analysis, functional analysis, probability theory textbooks. I prefer a systematic treatment, but … \n\n* reading takes a huge amount of time. I have the next conference deadline to meet, so I can’t just set aside two months without producing anything. My advisor wouldn’t be happy.\n* but if I don’t read, my mindless lego building will not yield anything publishable for the next conference. What a chicken-and-egg vicious cycle. \n* the “utility density” of reading those 1000-page textbooks is very low. A lot of pages are not relevant, but I don’t have an efficient way to sift them out. I understand that some knowledge *might* be useful *some day*, but the reward is too sparse to justify my attention budget. The vicious cycle kicks in again. \n* in the ideal world, I can query an **oracle** with “Langevin flow”. The oracle would return a list of pointers, “given your current math capability, you should first read chapter 7 of Bishop’s PRML book, and then chapter 10 of information theory, and then chapter 12 of …”. Google is not such an oracle for my purpose. \n\nI’m willing to spend 1 - 2 hours a day to polish my math, but I need a more effective oracle. \nIs it just me, or does anyone else have the same frustration? \n\nEDIT: I'd appreciate it if someone could recommend *specific* books or MOOC series that focus more on **intuition and breadth**. Google lists tons of materials on real analysis, functional analysis, information theory, stochastic process, probability and measure theory, etc. Not all of them fit my use case, since I'm not seeking to redo a rigorous math major. Thanks in advance for any recommendation! \n\nEDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many people from different backgrounds to join the discussion. Looks like there are many who resonate with me! And thank you so much for all the great advice and recommendations. Please keep adding links, book titles, and your stories!

                    "comment": "To help you find a remedy for your shortcomings it would help to know what you are trying to accomplish. First off, I am from germany, most of the math problems you seems to have are solved in school and the first 3 semesters as undergraduate. To study for yourself and books that help you with basic mathematics. [this is the Papula](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematische-Formelsammlung-Ingenieure-Naturwissenschaftler-German/dp/3658161949/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1506887257&sr=1-9&keywords=papula), a formula and knowledge collection, there is also a series of 3 books for most of the math you might need. If you dont speak german, maybe there is a similar collection in english.\n\nIn my opinion, you shouldn't force yourself in the role of a PhD student. What ever you think you should do, don't. You should first define what you want to become not what you should be according to your peers. As I told my students when I was teaching: \"Your Job as doctoral candidate is to find a place in the sandbox you feel comfortable playing in. If you understand your surroundings you can look up and see what others have done. Than you can plan your way how to build your sandcastle.\" (Also: doing the master is to understand that you don't know anything, and doing your doctorate is to learn the others know nothing as well.)\n\nYour adviser should have taught you systemic task assessment. So if you have not heard this before I try to sum it up for easy understanding. Besides I am not sure what your idea of ML is and what you have learned so far. I dearly hope it lies beyond just NNs. \n\na systemic task assessment:\n\n* define the state of knowledge, tools, understanding you already have. Like a table with grades, a simple list what every you feel comfortable. Make it as clear and simple.\n\n* define your goals; what is it, you want to have understood. PhD means to walk the border of the unknown, so what are the questions you have that needs to be answered\n\n* put this 2 pieces of paper in front of you, with a third one in between. Your job now is to find the \"shortest path for the accomplishment of your task\". Meaning using the a high abstraction, what is needed to solve your question.\n\n* In most cases you cant find a simple path just on the first try. If so you are, as we say, \"drilling a thin board\". I mostly start with the \"solution side\", so what is the step to be taken before you reach your goal (also try to define it abstract). And than the next and so on. Try to put a \"node\" to each side (start point and goal) till you let them meet. This is now your shortest path.\n\n* Now look at your steps, you will see in your minds eye a list of dependency, missing knowledge, something you need to work out.\nThat are your milestones to learn, experiment and analyse.\n\n* Now try to estimate the time frames you need to accomplish each sub-task, add them up and write them under each step. Now multiply that number with a factor between 3-20. This is your real esteemed now. Best way is to use hours as unit.\n\n* Now high efficient work per day is max about 2-4 hours. And for most people 2-3 days a week. Rest is, Posters, emails, calls, talking, drinking coffee and so on. Never try to overcompensate by forcing yourself to work more than 20 hours highly effective per week. You will burn out. Learning is a highly effective task.(If you actually want to learn the subject you are working on)\n\n* Now calculate all the time you might have and compare it with the workload you expect. If your task/project is to big, make it smaller. Till your median workload you can accomplish is in the limits of your Project estimate.\n\n* Now show it to a colleague, ask him about his estimate of your task without revealing yours. If it fits, all is good.\n\n* Every step contains sub-sub-task for you, try to plan them out. What is to study, what is it that others have done. Do I need tools I don't know yet, do I have to build them.\n\n* Write your own personal monthly schedule. Set a side at least 20% learning and reading time. \n\n* Check your speed of work and try to stay in the margin\n\n* Now in the process you will find new questions, new thinks you need to know. This will \"thicken\" your path. There are 2 kinds, the \"must have\" and the \"nice to have\", say good bye to the nice to have or do it in your free time as hobby. Sleep and reevaluate your \"must haves\" 90% of the time its a \"nice to have\".\n\n* you are finished with your smallest path before the time is up? Now you can feed it.(if it is a 3 year fellowship, you are in the beginning/mid of your 2nd year now) Try other smaller different ways between your steps. Write paper about it. Feed it till you have about 9 month left.\n\n* clean up! tie up your lose ends. Make a nice poster and write a last paper. Teach your the generation following you what you have learned, even just for fun. Its a great way to train speaking in front of people and its fun with undergrads.\n\nIn my experience you need to form your own intuitions. If you use \"second hand\" thinking as a substituent to your own, you might never move beyond the boarder in the unknown. ",

It won't pay off in time for the next conference (or likely even for the one after that) but eventually you build up a foundation you can work with.\n\nA big part of the utility of math (especially in ML) is having breadth rather than depth.  The strategy of picking out specific things you don't know from papers and looking them up is only effective if you have the breadth in your background to understand the answers you find.\n\nBroad knowledge is also what helps you manage the exponential tree of complexity you're encountering.  You won't have seen all the things you come across, but you'll develop the ability to make good judgements about what you need to read to achieve your goals.  You'll learn how to recognize when a reference you're reading is more (or less) technical than you need, and how to search for something more appropriate.  You'll also learn how and when you can use results without understanding the details.\n\nFinally, as a general grad student strategy trying to learn everything just in time is not a path to success.  Even if you had the perfect math oracle that you want it would be setting you up to be left behind.  All the oracle gives you is the ability to catch up quickly to the ideas of others.  Your job as a grad student is to generate new knowledge and to do that you need to seek things out on your own, not just follow along the latest trend.  Part of your job is to go out hunting for ideas that your peers haven't found yet and bring them back to your field.",

What is missing from the description above is that this is the first example of how human neurons are qualitatively different than rodent neurons (not only more computation power, but categorically different computation).\n\n**ELI5**: the way the biological human neuron implements XOR is by a formerly unknown type of local response to inputs, which is low below the threshold, maximal at the threshold and decreases as the input intensifies above the threshold. We never saw anything like that in any other animal. ([link to the relevant figure from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/gcJFiIZ.jpg))",

                    "comment": "> It has long been assumed that the summation of excitatory synaptic inputs at the dendrite and the output at the axon can only instantiate logical operations such as AND and OR (30). Traditionally, the XOR operation has been thought to require a network solution (31, 32). We found that the dCaAPs’ activation function allowed them to effectively compute the XOR operation in the dendrite by suppressing the amplitude of the dCaAP when the input is above the optimal strength (Fig. 2). Thus, on the basis of our results and those of previous studies (30, 33), we consider a model that portrays the somatic and dendritic compartments of L2/3 neurons as a network of coupled logical operators and corresponding activation functions (Fig. 3, F and G). In this model, the XOR operation is performed in the dendrites with dCaAPs, whereas AND/OR operations are performed at the soma and at tuft and basal dendrites with sodium and NMDA spikes, respectively (20, 25, 34, 35). **Our findings provide insights into the physiological building blocks that constitute the algorithms of cellular func- tion, which ultimately give rise to the cortical network behavior.**\n\nThe last sentence was highlighted in bold by me. I think it implies the artificial neuron is just a small subset of functions modeled by a real neuron. One can surely take inspiration from the real neuron but shouldn't be comparing the two.",

That the human neocortex would just compute a simple ANN \"perceptron-style\" function per area has never been seriously considered. \n\nIt's cool that the apical dendrites of these particular pyramidal neurons can be tuned for optimal incoming signal strengths without additional neurons, but there are also numerous very fast interneurons that allows much more complicated computations that are not really mapped out in any sane way yet either..\n\nSo there is much cool research to come, but I guess that there is a significant risk that it turns out it's an evolutionary mess - the equivalent of dirty quick hacks and patches of 10 consecutive consulting teams on a single codebase ;) For example, it might turn out that such a feature as that described in the article is actually not used to add a \"computation\" but is an evolutionary hack to compensate for some non-linearity or bug in a upstream neuron :)",

The  finding is that dendrites with the newly described ion channel dCaAP generate zero spikes at low input intensity, a dendritic spike after a threshold, but lower depolarization on even higher intensity (fig 2D ; in contrast to typical dendritic spikes which keep the same response in higher intensities). So it is like the input-output function of the dendrite is not a sigmoid but a symmetric gaussian, which is a good fit for calculating Xor of inputs (but not AND or OR). \n\nhttps://sci-hub.tw/https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6473/83/tab-pdf",

I feel most of my collaborators (including my advisors) are mostly running after papers and don't seem to have interest in doing interesting off-the-track things. Ultimately, research has just become chasing one deadline after another. Another thing that bugs me is that most of the research (including mine) is not very useful. Even if I get some citations, I feel that it is highly unlikely that the work I am doing will ever be used by the general public. Earlier, I was very excited about PhD, but now I think it will be worthless pursuit. Is what I feel valid? How do I deal with these feelings and rejuvenate my interest in research? Or should I switch to something else - maybe applied ML?",

First, science should not be judged by usefulness and history provides tons of examples, where useless findings suddenly became cornerstones of human technoculture. (My favorite example is GFP - fluorescent protein used widely in research and diagnostics, which wouldn't be discovered without a few odd scientists doing useless work with jellyfishes.) Second, I know that people here like to complain about quality of ML papers, but they are on average amazing in comparison to other sciences. Science as a whole has a problem with publishing incentives, but ML is one of the few fields that copes very well with the issue with all these githubs, papersofcodes, frequent conferences, strong industry etc.\n\nNow, on a more personal note. You just became a doomer. It's normal for folks in early adulthood. Replace \"research\" with \"life\" in that sentence about chasing one deadline after another - and welcome to the club! I had that too, loss of interest to the point in which I dropped out (from other stem program, not ml).

I mainly did NLP work for 3 years, I only used Pandas and Jupyter as a way of analyzing the data and navigating it before doing the actual work, why do I need to remember that? so not being able to one-line code (which is shitty BTW if you actually building a project you would get rid of pandas as much as you can) doesn't mean I'm good enough to be top 3% :D.\n\nI assume at this point top1% don't need to code right? they just mentally telepath with the tools and the job is done by itself.\n\nIf after all these years of working and building projects from scratch literally(doing all the SWE and ML jobs alone) doesn't matter cause I can't do one-line Jupyter pandas code, then I'm doomed.\n\nand Why the fuk everything is about speed these days?

At a high level, here are the main reasons why I find it hard to justify working 8+ hours a day on ML:\n\n1. **The world is burning** (Covid, climate change, social unrest), and I'm constantly wondering what the opportunity cost is for not doing something more immediately impactful and meaningful. I try to be more humble and accept that the world doesn't need me to \"save\" it. But it also feels wrong to just hunker down and tinker with hyperparameters all day.\n2. In the deep learning era, the day-to-day ML work feels like **shooting in the dark**. Honestly every time I try to do something principled and grounded in theory, reality slaps me in the face. It just doesn't work. What does work is anticlimactic: training bigger & longer, or arbitrarily tweaking BERT for whatever niche.\n3. **The field is so crowded**. The arxiv firehose is overwhelming and (forgive my cynicism) so full of noise. So much gets published everyday, yet so little. There's this crazy race to publish anything, regardless how meaningless that extra layer you added to BERT is. And while I really try to keep my integrity and not write a paper about how I swept the s\\*\\*\\* out of those hyperparameters and increased the average GLUE score by a whooping 0.2, realistically I still need to keep up with this crazy pace if I don't want to get fired.\n\nI feel trapped because I can't find pleasure neither in the process (which has become synonymous with throwing stuff at BERT and seeing what happens), nor the outcome (wasting huge amounts of compute power in a world that is burning, occasionally discovering mildly uninteresting things). At the end of the day, I'm depleted of energy and so can't rely on other areas of my life to fill in the void.\n\nEnlighten me! What's your secret? How do you keep going?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your thoughtful messages / advice and for sharing your experiences. You all gave me a lot of food for thought and hope that it's not all lost.",

Certainly other people are selling, just see all the noise on arxiv. Your instincts are solid about not publishing that, so double down on theory! Even for the best 95% of attempts to advance theory won't pan out, while pushing hyper parameters will get a marginal improvement way more often (usually by slowly overfitting the validation set.) Unsuccessful theory is still way less of a waste of time than manual hyper parameter search.",

I would highly recommend papers from FAccT conferences.\n\nAs a result, I find myself reading psychology, cognitive science, and sociology studies loads more.

            "description": "I have been hearing some negativity about PhDs recently, much of it justified I am sure. However, as someone who has largely enjoyed their PhD in reinforcement learning, I thought I might explain some of the great things that can come from a PhD and give my advice on things to consider. My advice is not scientific and I am sure many others have written better advice you should also read\\*. \n\nThat being said, here is a list of things which can make doing a PhD really satisfying:\n\n1. A productive relationship with your advisor/supervisor. If you are lucky, you will find a supervisor who is a world expert and who responds promptly to your questions, takes interest in your ideas and suggests helpful improvements.\n2. The opportunity to learn about interesting topics without expectation of concrete output.\n3. Day to day work which matches the skill set you want to develop\n4. The autonomy to build a project based on your own ideas\n5. The expertise of the lab and your ability to collaborate, receive feedback and socialise with them\n6. Getting a chance to intern with industry\n7. Publishing your work at top tier conferences and journals\n\nIf you can get all of these things out of your PhD it can be a really fun and worthwhile experience and, with a bit of luck, will set you up for great career opportunities afterwards. However, working things out before starting can be hard. So lets say you've narrowed it down to a few advisors, how do you evaluate points 1-7? Here are some tips:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Read carefully your potential advisor’s best publications and recent impactful work. Check if they have successfully supervised students in the past. Get in contact with current or past students to hear how they work with their supervisor currently. If you can, do a rotation project as part of a PhD program or Masters degree.\n2. Find out if people in the lab have a lot of pressure to publish. If they do, it may make it difficult to learn about other areas. Is your lab/University a hub for creative ideas from a variety of perspectives with opportunities to attend interesting lectures and interact with talented people?\n3. You will be an expert in the area(s) in which you do your PhD. Think about the skill set that would give you and your ability to sell that after the PhD. Equally, think about the process of acquiring those skills, and whether you would enjoy that process.\n4. Does your advisor already have a narrow project laid out for you or is it a broader picture (I would recommend the latter, although it does come with more risk). Does your advisor publish across a narrow range of topics or does he or she publish work in multiple related areas? Is that work high quality or low quality?\n5. Meet current lab members and try to get a sense of their interests, expertise and willingness to collaborate. If they have recent publications read them and ask them about it.\n6. An internship during your PhD is great both for learning and building a career. Machine learning is unusual in its ability to provide these opportunities so take them if you can!\n7. Do people in your lab regularly publish in top tier conferences and journals? Is their work widely cited, or more concretely, has it directly impacted research in the field?\n\nFinally, bear in mind that in reality it is very unlikely you have an opportunity which satisfies all these criteria, so be reasonable in your expectations, balance them against non-PhD opportunities and having evaluated all the evidence carefully, follow your gut. Good luck!\n\nOh, and one more thing:\n\nThe sunk cost fallacy is real. When thinking about your existing projects and future projects, don’t be afraid to change tack if you worked hard on an idea and it just isn’t panning out. Similarly, don’t be afraid to change supervisor and or people you collaborate with if you honestly gave it your best shot and things are not working out. Be aware of when you are spinning your wheels and not making progress and do everything you can (within reason of course) to get out of it. If things get really bad, don’t be afraid to drop out. A PhD should be about excitement and opportunity and not fear of failure. Save that for the rest of your life!\n\n\\*Sources of better advice include Richard Hamming and E.O Wilson\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzPcu0-ETTU&ab\\_channel=TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzPcu0-ETTU&ab_channel=TED)",

The advantage of tenured professors is that they will typically be more amenable to a hands-off approach where you can explore ideas after they do a basic sanity check on them - this will be extremely valuable if you see yourself as a creative thinker and want to take advantage of probably only time in the life where you have the freedom to try new ideas and fail. However, you will then be responsible for your work standing somewhat on its own, as your professor may not be doing popular, highly-cited research anymore.\n\nThe advantage of new, tenure-track professors is that you can ride their coattails as they become more famous for cutting-edge, immediately applicable and highly-cited fields that will get a lot of funding. You could become a common name just for creating a dataset, for example. The downside is that you will be serving to help them get tenure and your work will therefore be more restricted and focused, and from my observed experiences of others, more stressful. Not to mention that they may just decide to leave the university and you're stuck deciding whether you want to uproot your life just to follow them.\n\nThat being said, don't get a PhD if you think it's just the next step of schooling after Masters, as a PhD is very different from a Masters. In most cases, the Masters is focused on the courses you take, even if you have a final thesis. A PhD has courses, but they are secondary to the main focus of the program, which is teaching you how to make contributions to research. There are many people who are very smart, but aren't interested in trying new things and failing without much guidance.  If you are one of these people, you probably don't want to get a PhD. \n\nIf you're considering opportunity cost and the money, you also probably shouldn't get a PhD. In  terms of money earned over your lifetime, after taking into consideration the opportunity cost and ability to invest earnings earlier, the PhD won’t be worth it - you’ll likely break even. (This is true of many medical doctors too, btw). It will be worth it if you want to do research, however, because you can’t lead cutting-edge research without it (although you can certainly contribute  to it). It also would be worth it if you wanted to become a professor.  It’s about the career that you want - it’s not just an automatic boost in salary. I am able to work a wide variety of interesting and impactful things rather than just creating a new product that Amazon might never decide to use. I get to interact with a variety of fields, from medicine, biology, computer graphics, etc, rather than being in one division of one company.",

This book is very accessible.\n2. If you have time: start directly with Bishop's PRML (takes 3-6 months). This is for me the best ML book. ESL is kind of equivalent, but a bit harder (I'm not talking to you graduates in statistics :P).\n3. If you want to start with deep learning: take Chollet's Deep Learning with Python. The guy is controversial but his book is not. This is an excellent book for beginners. Géron's hands-on ML is also good (and more comprehensive), but I still find Chollet's better. There was a time I was looking for an alternative book written for PyTorch, but none came close. I haven't read the recent \"Deep Learning with PyTorch\" or FastAI's \"Deep Learning for Coders\", so I'm unable to comment on those.\n4. Feedback on Goodfellow et al.'s Deep Learning has been mixed. People have their own opinions, and here's mine: forget about it for the moment, especially if you are a beginner. I read the entire thing and I learnt quite a lot of things, but I have to say that this is not a good *textbook*. Use it rather as a reference.",

            "description": "I'm a PhD student in the middle of my studies. A year ago I had an idea  about designing a neural network for medical image segmentation using  shape priors. I have done a quick literature review at that time  (although I admit, it might not have been thorough enough) and I found  that no one really tried to use those shape priors before, especially  for the task that i wanted to use them on (these descriptors would fit  the specific task especially well). I worked hard on the implementation,  designing the network architecture, writing the article and  understanding all the necessary mathematical proofs/theorems related to  this task. I just submitted the article a few weeks ago (no word from it yet), and today, I  found an article on arxiv (no citations) that has been published this  spring and basically uses the same idea for the same task as I did. The  network architecture is different than mine and the performance  evaluation is different, but the main selling point of my article, the  usage of these shape priors has already been published. I am a bit  devastated at this point because this would have been my first 1st  author paper and I really put a lot of effort and thought into this,  only to discover that my idea has already been discovered before.  Obviously I need to do a much more thorough literature review next time  so that this doesn't happen again, but besides that, I don't know what  else I could do to mitigate the damage that has been done to my  motivation. I am even considering quitting PhD at this moment because I  feel like I wasted a lot of time because of my stupidity. Has anything  similar happened to you before? Do you have any advice? How could you  cope with similar issues in your career?",

Traditional defenses fall short when handling this type of encoded input.\n\n𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗴𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 73.6% 𝗦𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗲\nAcross 13 top-tier models, including GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘀 𝘀𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗻 73.6% 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀—compared to just 1% for direct, unmodified harmful prompts. This reveals the scale of the threat and the limitations of current safeguards.\n\n𝗦𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗘𝘃𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘃𝗶𝗮 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝗻𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴\nBy converting language-based threats into math problems, the encoded prompts slip past existing safety filters, highlighting a 𝗺𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗳𝘁 that AI systems fail to catch. This represents a blind spot in AI safety training, which focuses primarily on natural language.\n\n𝗩𝘂𝗹𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗠𝗮𝗷𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗜 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀\nModels from leading AI organizations—including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini—were all susceptible to the MathPrompt technique.

            "description": "Figured I should write this stuff down before I forget it all, and where better for TaskManager than r/techsupport!  If there's any appetite for this, I'll expand on it!   I don't blog, so here goes...\n\n\\[TLDR?  See also Dave's Task Manager's History on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNzszbnvQeFzObW0ghk0Ckw) \\]\n\nSome Task Manager lore: I'm the Microsoft (Redmond, '93) developer that wrote TaskMgr at home in my den in about 1994 and then the NT silverback devs let me check it into the main tree even though I was a greenhorn at the time.  So that meant I got to bring it into work and polish it up and make it an official part of Windows, where it remains to this day.  So I got to define my own day job, actually, which was nice!  I don't know if it's still like that, but great culture and people.\n\nThis is all based on XP, as I left long ago, but it's still the same core app underneath.  In no particular order:\n\n\\- If Task Manager ever hangs or crashes, start another by pressing ctrl-shift-esc.  Winlogon will look for an existing instance and try to revive it for up to 10 seconds.  If the old Taskmgr doesn't start making sense by responding with a secret code within that time, another one will be launched.  That way, you're never without a Taskmgr as long as there are some resources available.\n\n\\- Task Manager will load in reduced mode if resources are short, like only loading the Processes page if that's what's needed to get going.  It's one of the very few apps that won't just \"fail and bail\" when things go wrong.\n\n\\- If Task Manager ever becomes internally corrupted, kill/close it.  Restart it while holding down CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT, and Task Manager will reset ALL internal settings to factory fresh if it sees that key combo at startup.  Same works for every app I've written, btw, I think!\n\n\\- If all your titlebars disappear and you just have a graph, double-click dead client space to switch back to normal mode.  This no-titlebar mode is a mode I added to follow the NT clock, where you could remove borders as well, but it confused more people than it ever helped I'm sure!\n\n\\- I initially drew the meters as 7-segment LEDs but that wasn't localizable to all cultures (How do you do a right-to-left reading 7-segment LED for Saudi Arabia?) so they only lasted for one version or so.\n\n\\- CTRL-SHIFT-ESC will launch Taskmgr without any help from the Shell, so if the Shell/Explorer is dead use this key combo to bring up TM and then reset/restart the shell.  Even if your tray is missing and gone, this combo should start it.\n\n\\- If the shell can't start something or is hung, try Task Manager.  It has a mode where it will load without ANY references to the shell32.dll and allow you to start programs like CMD.EXE without the start menu.\n\n\\- You can find the binary for any executing process in the process table by right clicking and pick \"Show File Location\".  You can also search it online, but I don't know if they have useful info for much.\n\n\\- There should be nothing that TaskMgr can't kill - it will even escalate privilege and (if you have it) enable debug privilege to attach to and kill apps that way if needed.  If TM can't kill it, you've got a kernel problem.\n\n\\- A lot of people don't seem to know you can add many additional columns, remove others, drag them around to reorder, etc.\n\n\\- The reason there's a Window class called \"DavesFrameWndProc\" is because to get flicker-free resizing I needed group boxes to not try to paint on one another, so subclass them, give them their own wndproc, and enabling WS\\_CLIPSIBLINGS during WM\\_CREATE.  At least I think so!\n\n\\- TM is one of the apps I'm most proud of because it is probably the first or at least most visually complicated app to ever be fully resizable in all dimensions without any flicker up till then.  I was hardcore about memory and flicker in my day, so it was under 100K for the exe and never flashed or crashed, that was my thing!  Having the GDI32 and User32 guys down the hall sure helped.\n\nI also wrote/ported Space Cadet pinball, zip folders, worked on start menu, shell, calc, ole32, product activation, and some other stuff.  I was in MS-DOS before that but I doubt anyone is still supporting MS-DOS!\n\nEdit:  Looks like comments have been locked, so I'll update this one time with some answers to the most interesting/common questions below!\n\n\\- On the command line, I'm stumped, as I don't remember command line args to it at all!\n\n\\- On Space Cadet, yes, you can run it on Windows 10, but I doubt it's official or legal, so will point you at your favorite search engine for that one, but it's easy.  And on Space Cadet, reminder that Maxis did the very original (M. Ridgeway) and mine was just a rewrite in 32-bit portable C using their art.  That way it ran on the PowerPC, Alpha, and MIPS as well.  And yes, in the original there is a \"God Mode\" where you can drag the ball around, click on targets, etc.  Search is your friend there as well.\n\n\\- On what I'm doing these days, I volunteer to teach kids to program at school, or used to until recently, so now I'm mostly coding and working on my coding channel, which you can follow here: [https://bit.ly/36wDLJK](https://bit.ly/36wDLJK) and I also restore old musclecars, pickups, etc.  So yes, I still code every day!\n\n\\- On the notion that there are some things that Taskmgr can't kill, there were post-XP for sure but they were intentional limits.  I remember something about journalists making news by using TM to kill the root winlogon session, for example, which would bugcheck the machine intentionally.  But the fact you could bluescreen NT didn't look good, I suspect, so they likely started to protect people from themselves by disallowing killing win32k.sys and other essential components.\n\n\\- Thanks to the mods for being flexible on this one!",

It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. \\[Source: Wikipedia.com\\]\n\n \n\n**How did I get infected?**\n\nIt is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher’s website directly.\n\n \n\n**How to prevent future infections:**\n\nBe very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using [Ninite](http://ninite.com) for installing/updating software is very easy & safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.\n\n \n\n**The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:**\n\n \n\n**Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:**\n\n* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)\n* [BitDefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)\n* [ESET Free Online Scanner](http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/)\n\nFree AVs will only go so far.

This has been [proven again recently with Avast](https://www.cnet.com/news/antivirus-firm-avast-is-reportedly-selling-users-web-browsing-data/).

            "description": "Hey, some time ago I got through an issue where all websites would be very slow, throttled by the ISP, but when I run a **Speedtest**, it shows that I have a speed of ***70Mbps***, which in no way can be real when I can't even play YouTube videos.\n\nSo, I knew **they were throttling every website that is not Speedtest**, so I thought of an idea, I set up an OpenVPN server and set the `http-proxy Host` (SNI) to [**www.speedtest.net**](http://www.speedtest.net), so that all websites would be treated as Speedtest, and this actually worked. I got my full speed on the other websites that were being throttled.\n\nA few days ago, they seem to have patched that, it no longer gives me full speed on all websites, except that Speedtest still has the full speed working.\n\nMy question is, what could be the workaround that they applied so that `Host` HTTP header would no longer be applied, while their Speedtest are still being whitelisted, getting the full speed.\n\nAnd is there anything I can do to fix that? Any ideas what could have changed so that I can working on it from there?\n\nThank you so much\n\n**Edit**:\n\nWow, I really was not expecting the post to get all of this interaction, there are some repeated comments sorry I will have to reply to here, because they are just too much for me to answer xD\n\n1. The reason I am trying to find a technical solution and not ask the company itself for help is, the company's customer support miserably sucks, people who have no idea about technology just send repeated messages like \"Restart the router, it is a general issue, it seems to me like you have full speed\", and I really will not get any help from them, as **they are INTENTIONALLY throttling my speed**.\n2. Testing through other speed testing websites like [fast.com](https://fast.com) & other websites, gives me 1/3 to 1/2 and sometimes even less than the speed I am subscribed to, although my line can handle 2x the speed I am subscribed to.\n3. Changing ISP is not an option for me, there is only 1 real ISP in the country, and all the others, you could maybe call resellers, all have the same rules, plans & prices. So I am trying to find a \"trick\", that can be done by me without having to go to them as this might be my only possibility of getting the speed I am subscribed to.\n\nI am very thankful & grateful for everyone trying to help, now since I don't really have any solutions in my head and there weren't many technical answers (tho I really do appreciate everyone taking time to answer), I will be replying in case there's something I can help you with, but for my shitty ISP, I will probably have to figure it out as some of you have suggested by looking into the Headers in case they have added new ones for verification.\n\nThank you one more time :D",

If not, what exactly did you do? \n\nI want to know this workaround since if in future my ISP decides to do the same, I would try this first. \nI guess my cell provider already does this because the 4G internet is shit while doing anything else, whereas if I run a speedtest using their own app provided for checking internet, it gives full speed and they upfront tell me your internet is working fine, the other apps might have a problem. And they insist on me using their own speedtest app and don't accept screenshots of other speedtest apps, saying they are not accurate. This really infuriates me. \n\nThanks.",

Since you have mentioned that they are a publicly-owned ISP, I may guess that the government's and maybe the army's (since it is Egypt) websites will not be throttled. Luckily, these websites are usually vulnerable since they are accessed and updated less frequently, and their budgets are usually smaller compared to Ookla, so if the problem was patched on Ookla's side the vulnerability may still exist on the official websites. I would say finding a vulnerability in these sites may be easier if you were going the hacker path. \n\nI'm sorry this may not be on the technical level you sought, but the lack of technical responses here and the seemingly non existent reading skills has astonished me that I wanted to write something which may somehow help, or at least give you an idea to work off. \n\nBest of luck with that !",

I am 21 now so that was like 8 years ago and earlier this year I got a pair of airpods, and when I connected them to my phone they were automatically named “Little Vietnamese Schoolgirl’s Airpods”. No Problem, I changed the name of the airpods and forgot about it. But today I was at work and I joined a Microscoft Teams meeting with my airpods in, and it said that it was connected with “Little Vietnamese Schoolgirl’s Airpods” for some reason. I just hope to god it didn’t say that on my bosses screen, but he didn’t react strangely so I don’t think it did. I’m just waiting for the day that this comes back to screw me over though, so if anyone can help me I would be very grateful. When I go into settings and look at my name, it just shows my actual name. When I ask Siri “what is my name?” or “what do you call me?” it also just says my reals name. But somewhere in my Apple ID or something I am still a Little Vietnamese Schoolgirl and I need help.",

Just get off their wifi and use your cell net when surfing where they think you shouldn't be. Problem solved. And yes with a well configured network and a mesh of APs we can tell precisely where your phone is within 6 meters. And identify your phone from session to session. We have found lost phones and located local thieves using this tech (you have to rely on cell and geolocation with Android or Apple off campus).  Assume if you are on a network your traffic is being monitored. They may not be able to see individual packets (as in what pornvid you are watching) but they know that there is a traffic flow between you and that site.  They can tell and track volume of data to any individual phone and track that phone session to session.  If the system deploys integrated cameras on campus they can even potentially map video to phone use by an individual. It really is pretty big brother.  Yes a vpn can block some of that but as others have pointed out ~ use of the vpn might be all they need and they can track that too.",

In the past few months my YouTube history has occasionally had weird videos like nude modeling sessions, see through lingerie try on's and even vaginal waxing all uncensored and on YouTube. I myself don't seek out anything like that on YouTube and I even changed my password the first time it happened. Tonight it's happened again and I can't for the life of me figure it out I checked all devices connected to my Google account and there's nothing out of the ordinary. Most of the vids have Hindi titles so I  assume it's someone in India either beating one off or they're fucking with me. Thanks for any input or similar situations.",

Tor with bridges can be highly censorship resistant. Just note that it wouldn't be too hard to discover that you are using Tor, so please consider what the consequences of using Tor might be, assess personal risk, and evaluate whether it's worth it to you.\n\nHaving VPNs is also good, and I would argue the more the better. Install a few free ones like [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/yo/2w9qxg4u) and [hide.me](https://hide.me) \\- that way if one provider gets blocked, you can shift over to another. Similarly it's not hard to discover that you are using a VPN, so assess personal risk.\n\nFinally, always be on your toes. You will find that it's a game of whack-a-mole - every time a way to circumvent the block comes up, the government will block it. So make sure you have spare Tor bridges that you can switch to if your existing bridges get blocked and so on.\n\n**Edit: Even if you aren't at risk of a firewall in your country, install Tor.** I strongly believe that every person should have Tor with a few bridges ready, so that if for whatever reason you come under risk of censorship you have already begun your preparations. And installing a free VPN won't hurt either.\n\nEdit 2: Using public wifi might help you remain anonymous, if that is necessary.",

            "description": "All,\n\nAs the moderation team of r/techsupport, we have concerns about recent changes to Reddit.\n\nA recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/comment/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.\n\nThis isn't only a problem for users: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.\n\nAccordingly, the moderation team of r/techsupport is declaring its opposition to this API pricing change, and will be __shutting down the subreddit in solidarity for at least 48 hours starting June 12th__.\n\n#####__How can you help?__\n\n* Please consider reading and signing the open letter found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding). \n\n* SHARE SHARE SHARE! Post your thoughts on social media platforms! Spread awareness! \n\nWe are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause. We understand many users rely on our subreddit for help, but we truly believe this is in the best interest of the community. However, our Live Chat (on Discord) will remain open while the subreddit is dark.\n\n-- r/techsupport Mod Team\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Additional Resources:_\n\n[What We Want](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh2te/what_we_want/)\n\n[Don't Let Reddit Kill 3rd Party Apps!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/)\n\n[Reddit is killing 3rd-party Apps (infographic)](https://preview.redd.it/91zby5ht044b1.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=746417bbd904506fc8c7b9c702c16b7fbb47bf06)\n\n[Reddit to the Visually Impaired: \"You no  longer have a voice on this site.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13zbf3n/reddit_to_the_visually_impaired_you_no_longer/)\n\n[How Reddit Became the Enemy - w/ Apollo Developer Christian Selig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypwgu1BpaO0)\n\n_Subreddits with Additional Information:_\n\n[r/Save3rdPartyApps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps)\n\n[r/ModCoord](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord)\n\nEdit: More resources added",

I moved (almost) all my stuff from my apartment to my minivan.\n\nIn September 2021, I arrived back again at the university. I went straight to my minivan which was parked for 18 months to fetch my two old iphones which have huge sentimental value, iPhone 4 with a leather case, and iPhone 6s. Little did I know that they were nowhere to be found. I realized I left my iphones behind in my apartment when I moved out back in March 2020. The apartment already had 3 different tenants move in and out since I left.\n\nIn January 2022, I receive a notification that the iPhone 4 is found! Great news!\nexcept it is more than 7000 kms away in a rural area in Africa. I remote wiped it straight away. My iPhone 6s is still lost without any trace.",

She's a very social cat and gets depressed and acts off for days whenever she's left alone for very long.  \n\nI recently discovered cat TV channels on youtube that play 8 hour videos of things like birds or mice just being birds and mice.  [She LOVES it](https://imgur.com/a/kI2umb5) \\- even more than staring out the window.  She spends entire days staring at it, rolling around on the floor purring at it, chirping back at it.  She takes breaks only for food and to use the litter box.  When a video ends, it automatically goes on to the next one of that type.  I want to be able to leave this on for her when I'm away, and I'm not sure if it's youtube or my TV, but it pauses regularly to ask if I'm still watching.  \n\nIs there a way to turn this feature off and have it play continuously?  I've checked the settings and can't find anything.\n\nTLDR; How do I play youtube on my TV continuously for 40 hours without it pausing to ask if I'm still watching.  Asking for my cat.",

Every so often there is an interesting job and I was hoping if there was a bit of a tool that can assist me.\n\nI came into work this morning and saw 2 computers just sitting under the desk. I was told that a lady brought in the computers with 2 4TB Drives as well and wanted us to go through them getting all the family pictures from them. Sounds fine. Though the catch is it contains mostly Porn. Most likely a mixture if images and videos.\n\nThe customer only wants family images, though it is a grueling task sorting through all that porn and I'm thinking I'm going to have some trouble sleeping for a while, as the person who will store that much porn on their computer will most likely be looking at some weird stuff.\n\nWhat I want to know is there any tools that I can use to automatically sort through all images, and only return the ones that are not pornographic. Sort of like the things that are used on search engines in schools or in general with the safe search.",

            "description": "Hi there internet citizen! \n\nApologies in advance for the long-winded rant but I have exhausted the extent of corporate overlord sanctioned tech support scripting and have failed to resolve my issue. The following is not meant as a criticism of any brands or companies mentioned, and I must offer my commendation for the friendly customer service representatives I spoke to, but whilst they were well-intentioned, they were ultimately unhelpful.\n\nIn a nutshell, I have purchased and installed three fairly recent games on Steam - games that my system can run well.  My first problem was that I had to run these games through Origin; EA won't let Valve run their games through the Steam client, so whenever I try to launch it through Steam it automatically opens the Origin client. This in itself wouldn't be more than a minor inconvenience, except that the Origin client will NOT recognise the game clearly installed on my harddrive. Because it is installed through Steam, the Origin client seems to think I still need to download the game, yet trying to then download the game through Origin results in one of two scenarios:\n\n1) If not yet installed, will force install the game through Steam.\n\n2) If already installed, says that the game could not be downloaded and to try again. \n\nSo, running the game presents me with this unusual and insurpassable obstacle. I explained my dilemma to an EA rep who guided me through the standard uninstall/re-install procedures and some basic troubleshooting. Predictably, this did nothing except delay me further as after uninstalling the game I had to wait three days for it to download again (thank the australian internet for that). \n\nEventually another EA rep helped me get one step further by guiding me through how to fix issues on STEAMS end... He advised that I should clear my download cache and repair the library folders on the Steam client, which I did. I then loaded everything back up again and SUCCESS(!) Origin no longer recognises that the game is not installed! It now just refuses to play it at all. Every time I click play it ... does nothing? Starts doing a first time set up (through steam) and then just.... nothing. Resets the Origin client and takes me back to their home page and that's it? \n\nI also reached out to Steam support for help but they told me that they weren't able to help - basically said I had to speak to EA or get a refund (despite me trying to get a refund in the past and being rejected because the aforementioned slow internet caused me to not finish downloading these games until their refund period had expired... this isnt the case for all of them, I am generalising, but still... i reached out for a solution, not a shoulder shrug). Makes me wonder why I can even purchase these games through Steam at all? \n\nIf anyone has experienced this same problem and can offer a more helpful solution I would be immensely grateful - even if you haven't been able to fix it, at least I can feel validated in that it is not just me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; \n\n* Bought a game through Steam, requires Origin to run. \n* Origin forces game to be installed via Steam, Steam forces game to be played via Origin. \n* Origin won't recognise install. Can't play the game. Sadface.jpg\n* Spoke to EA; couldn't provide a workaround.\n* Spoke to Steam; told me to speak to EA.\n\nActions attempted:\n\n* Reinstalled game\n* Reinstalled Origin client\n* Tried running game in compatibility mode / as admin\n* Verified game file integrity through Steam\n* Cleared download cache through Steam\n* Repaired library folders through Steam\n* Modified game access pathway through Origin both directly to Steam directory and default Origin directory\n* Beat head against desk",

Apparently the man just let the gas out in the middle of a shopping centre (it’s in the middle of a mall walkway) with no protection, and then taped the battery holes over (I checked, he popped each of the sells and just placed electrical tape over)\n\nI’m going to be replacing the battery myself, but am I overreacting to go talk to the tech guy about how dangerous this is?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/tmoErHL\n\n\nUPDATE: Went and talked to the guy, he reckons it’s safe and that they use a special glue to seal it up.

A few months ago it started having framerate issues, running around 50fps but with really bad fluctuations and frame drops when I moved or jumped, making it pretty unplayable. After months of searching for a solution, I found one last night at the very bottom of a steam discussion thread: Run it with VLC media player open. And it works. It works perfectly. Consistent 60fps with no fluctuations. I don't understand it at all. I don't know how the two would even interact, let alone how it improves performance. So just a few minutes ago I was thinking about it and I decided to try it with another game, Halo Combat Evolved for PC, which would only run at 15-20 fps before. Perfect 60. What the fuck.

They answer the phone and acting like I called them. It started out with local numbers but now it’s coming from Washington and California.\nI have called the numbers back and looked them up and they are real Pizza Hut numbers yet the employees act like I’m prank calling them saying they called me. I have to answer the Oregon ones because I’m waiting on an important call from work.\nDoes anyone know what’s going on or how I can stop it?\n\nEdit: I just got of an hour long phone call with Pizza Hut support (I still don’t know why they exist) and the can’t block my number because stores are independent but they said they are sending out a memo to every store saying to block my number.\n\nEdit for day 2: it is still going on and I’m currently at Verizon changing my number. They think it is probably just some kid using something called prank hotline. For anyone wondering about my call luckily I was able to make a google voice number and have him call that.\n\nFinal edit: I have changed my number but was able to keep my old number on a flip phone I just bought for $5 and a month phone plan to see how long this goes on. It has not stopped and the people at Verizon at first thought it was funny but as it kept happening they were getting annoyed and recommended going to the police. I called the non emergency number and they told me to go to my local police station I did and they all almost died laughing at how pizza huts kept calling me. After a while talking to them they decided to take the phone as evidence. I was kinda sad to see it go but I hope they catch whoever it is. I honestly have no idea who would do this. Although I doubt they will be caught. I emailed the guys from that podcast but since I don’t have the phone anymore do doubt there is anything they can do.

Basically what this means is that if you're still using it, you should probably stop using it, or patch it with ESU, or do something else to stay protected.\n\nIn this post we'll be going over some of the options you have, including:\n\n* Upgrade to Windows 10.\n* Switch to a Linux distro such as Ubuntu.\n* Switch to a Mac, if you don't like the above.\n* Modify your system to allow ESU patches.\n* Unplug your Windows 7 computer from the Internet.\n* Keep using your Windows 7 computer as-is and risk malware.\n* Stop using desktop computers entirely.\n\nWe'll also go over some ways to stay secure, regardless of which of the above you choose.\n\nLinusTechTips also has a great video on this topic, you may wish to check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFHBBN0CqXk\n\n# Upgrade to Windows 10\n\nFor many people reading this post, this is your best option.\n\nUpgrading to Windows 10 is the only option that guarantees you can keep using *all* of the latest software and playing *all* of the latest Windows games. Many newer games, especially VR games, only support Windows 10 (and not Windows 7 or 8.1).\n\nThere is still some choices you can make of which version and edition of Windows you want. Windows 10 has various editions, including Home, Pro, Education, and Enterprise. Enterprise gives you the most control over your system, while Home gives you the least control over it, and Pro is somewhere in-between. Enterprise is not typically available to consumers, you have to go through a business. Education has the same feature set as Enterprise, but it is licensed for schools.\n\nIf you are in school, you should see if you are eligible for a license for Windows 10 Education. If not, see if you have a way to obtain a Windows 10 Enterprise license. If not, you can very likely [upgrade your Windows 7 or 8.1 installation for free](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/). If none of those options work for you, and you need to pay for a new license, the Pro version is preferable to the Home version.\n\nAside from installing and activating manually, you could also just buy a new computer that comes with Windows 10.\n\nThe main downside to upgrading to Windows 10 is that it gives you less control over your system, with features such as auto-installing apps (not a problem on Enterprise and Education editions), forced updates, Cortana, and vastly more \"telemetry\" services. Even if you hate spying, Windows 10 still may be your best option simply due to the advantage of running all the latest AAA games.\n\nMicrosoft provides an official way to download Windows 10 here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10\n\nIf you need help installing a newer version of Windows, check out this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/wiki/windowsinstallation\n\n# Switch to a Linux distro such as Ubuntu\n\nThese days, Linux distros are truly a great alternative to Windows. Linux is very stable and secure, and does everything an average user wants, whether that be Facebook or writing essays. If you are a gamer, Linux has thousands of native games and many more are available via Proton, you can play the majority of games on Steam on Linux with no hassle.\n\nIf you play games with heavy DRM or anti-cheat, or play VR games, or frequently use Adobe products, Linux may not be a good option for you. But even if you do play those games or use those products, you also have the option of dual-booting, so that you can have both Windows and Linux installed at the same time. This post doesn't go too much into detail on Linux, since the below links are already great resources.\n\nMost importantly, Linux is 100% free, so you can give it a try without any risks, and switch back to Windows whenever you wish.\n\nFor more information about switching to Linux, see this post on the Linux gaming subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/edaq0s/guide_migrating_to_linux_in_2020/\n\nWhen you are ready to install Linux, check out this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/wiki/linuxinstallation\n\nIf you'd like a more concrete guide, this PDF focuses specifically on setting up Ubuntu for gaming, including setting up drivers, Steam, and more, with a focus on dual-booting: https://github.com/aaronfranke/Linux-tools/raw/master/ubuntu-only/qsg.pdf\n\n# Switch to a Mac\n\nThis is the only option that *requires* you to buy new hardware, since MacOS only runs on Macs, and will not run on a non-Mac PC. Macs are great systems overall, they are very secure and are a favorite option of many developers and businesses.\n\nThe downsides of Mac are that it is expensive, and if you are a gamer, that it runs vastly fewer games. These days, Mac is a worse choice for gaming than Linux is.\n\n# Modify your system to allow ESU patches\n\nMicrosoft is selling [Extended Support Updates](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4527878/faq-about-extended-security-updates-for-windows-7) for Windows 7 users who can't upgrade for whatever reason. This is aimed at businesses, but you can still get ESU for Windows 7 Professional edition. [The cost of ESU](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-much-will-staying-patched-on-windows-7-cost-you-heres-the-price-list/) is $50 for the first year, $100 for the second year, and $200 for the third year. If you can't afford this, there may be unofficial methods to obtain these updates.\n\n# Disconnect your Windows 7 computer from the Internet\n\nThis is a fairly simple option that doesn't need too much explanation. If you unplug your computer from the Internet, you can't get viruses from the Internet. As long as you don't pass around infected USB flash drives, then you are pretty much immune from viruses if you aren't connected to the Internet. Of course, for many people, this makes your computer unusable.\n\n# Keep using your Windows 7 computer as-is and risk malware\n\nThis is a terrible option, since it's very insecure to do this. This option maybe isn't too bad if you don't have any sensitive data whatsoever on your machine, and it's an option worth mentioning, but this option is not recommended.\n\n# Stop using desktop computers entirely\n\nIf you don't like newer versions of Windows, or Linux distros, or Mac, you need to be on the Internet, and you don't want to be insecure, then the only\\* option left is to stop using desktop computers entirely. For a lot of people, this is an unacceptable option, but many people can get away with living in the modern world only using phones and tablets, so it's worth mentioning.\n\nAlso, Chromebooks are great if you don't need to do anything on your computer except for browsing the web.\n\n# How to stay secure on any system\n\nNo matter what you choose, there are plenty of ways to stay secure online.\n\nBlocking ads helps a ton due to malvertizing. The browser extension uBlock Origin ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/ublock/)) does a great job at blocking ads. Additionally, it's a great idea to get a [hosts-file adblocker](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts) or a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) to block ads before they even get to your system in the first place.\n\nThe browser extension HTTPS Everywhere ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/https-everywhere/)) will automatically redirect you to the secure version of a website, if there is one. This is a simple and easy way to improve your security while browsing the web.\n\nIf you are running Windows of any kind, getting an anti-virus is generally a good idea. One of the most commonly recommended ones is [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com). A really nice feature of Malwarebytes is that it can run alongside other anti-virus software, so you can use Malwarebytes regardless of if you already have an anti-virus.\n\nDon't forget that these can also be installed on smartphones, not just your desktop PC!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nYou should do something to stay secure. Whether you switch to a newer version of Windows, switch to a Linux distro such as Ubuntu, switch to a Mac, unplug your computer from the Internet, or throw it away, they all result in you staying more secure than if you continue to use your computer as-is. And once you've decided what system you're going to use, there are many ways to make it more secure.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions on how to improve this guide, feel free to leave a comment below!",

When you get to the phase where it asks you where you want to install Windows, right click on the drive and reformat it.\n\nThere are a lot of good guides on how to install Windows from 0(and format your drive while at it), use Google to find any of them.

Also theres other things that can scan as well, another one is the same company as malwarebytes, i forgot its name right now.

Need suggestions to implement on network level to block computer and iPhone traffic to dangerous sites. \n\nIs there a DNS service I can use to route her home's internet through to block the dangerous clicks? OpenDNS used to offer a blacklist feature and not sure who has something similar now. Happy to pay for service.  \n\nNote: I speak tech, know enough about DNS to be dangerous, and can follow guides, but don't know about services in the space.

It follows some mildly-dark porn accounts (which shouldn\"t be on Instagram) and stupid stuff. My best guess is some old school friend or etc. made it for fun, or to make me look bad. I reported it the moment I saw it. 10 minutes after this, MY proper Instagram profile got deleted. I guess the fake IG profile is older than the real one, because it has a 2013 pricture of me and I made my IG acc. about 2 years ago. But still, what the f***? By the way, my IG profile is connected to my Facebook but that part of it is unharmed. Can I do anything to get my account back and delete the  fake one?",

I bought him a Windows 10 laptop and things were so fast.  \n\nIt's obvious he clicked on things he shouldn't have and now on task manager, the CPU and memory are at 100% all the time. This new laptop is running like it's ancient technology.\n\nI have tried everything. I downloaded the top programs for malware/virus detection/removal. Ran each program, and nothing notable. \n\nAs a last resort I completely reset computer to factory settings and even still CPU and memory are at 100%. I also reinstalled windows with no notable changes afterwards. \n\nIs there something someone can recommend? Can provide more info if needed.\n\nEDIT and Solved: I learned something very important today. There is a difference between resetting a computer, and reinstalling Windows using the media creation tool. \n\nWhatever was on that old copy of Windows 10 is now gone because this laptop is running VERY smooth.\n\nI'm putting admin locks to avoid any shady downloads.

If attackers have breached your network this will kick them out and hopefully ensure they stay out.\n\nAs for whether or not this is possible I’m not for sure as I’m no expert on google products. The closest thing to a scenario like this is PewDiePie Chromecast hack from 2019, which allowed attackers to exploit specific settings on some routers and allow Google homes smart devices to not only be viewable on the internet but also allow people to gain control of them. This led to a mini “promotion” where the attackers would send chrome cast messages to people's TVs that would encourage them to subscribe to PewDePie ([article](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-streaming-pewdiepie-videos-on-exposed-chromecast-devices/) if you want to know more). As you can imagine this understandable panicked a lot of people having no idea that their google home devices were hijacked.\n\nBased on this article not only is this plausible scenario for what your going through but based on what you said about the “spirit” asking for personal information about you and your family is also consistent with an attacker trying to gather as much information as possible which will help prepare them to go after critical systems you control (bank account, email, etc)\n\n**TLDR: In short, yes your mom is getting scammed.

It's important to recognize the security breach and inform others on how to prevent it.\n\nIf your family doesn't believe they're scammers, just say the devices are broken and you need to get them repaired.

I figured it was hacked somehow (despite the fact I use two-factor authentication) or my phone had a virus and had been spamming, etc. I followed the prompts to file an appeal and was directed to a single text box where I needed to justify why the account should be reinstated.  I'm a long-term customer and have never been warned or suspended for anything. I was surprised to see they didn't have the professional courtesy to tell me why it was suspended or to provide a warning if they observed anything that would even lead to a suspension.  After talking to someone at Google Fi and then Google Play I was advised that the only thing I could do was submit a response via the form and there was nothing they could do. \nI replied on the web form and then left for the week on business travel.\n\nLet me take a break with the story to tell you about some of the Google products I rely on:\n\n-Fi (signed up when it was still a beta service, just updated to a Pixel 4 XL)\n-Nest (awesome that now requires a Google account)\n-Gmail (used for all of my personal correspondence)\n-Drive\n-Chrome\n-Others\n\nI received a response THREE DAYS LATER that the account would not be reinstated and had violated the Terms of Service with no further explanation and a link to them for my review. The fact that my home security, text messaging, email, and storage were already out for a few days while I was away from my family was bad enough, but I was absolutely stunned to receive this kind of treatment by a company of this magnitude. I replied again, asking for some justification or steps I could follow to get the account reinstated and have not received a response. That was four days ago. I attempted to port my number to another provider on Friday to get my text messaging reinstated, but get this--the folks at Google Fi can't give you your account info if you can't authenticate with their app which is connected to your Google account!\n\nIt's been over a week since the account was suspended and I have made no progress. Has anyone out there made it through the bureaucracy and gotten their account reinstated? Any other ideas?",

Make the wrong comments on YouTube videos, you could be considered to be verbally harming the other commenters and pop goes your account. \n\nAs for them not telling you why, they no longer have to according to the TOS:\n\n> We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube **unless** **we reasonably believe that to do so:** (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or **(c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.** Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service. \n\nSo if you insulted a \"monetized content creator\" on YouTube that person could assert they were harmed and have your Google account suspended and they don't even have to tell you that is why.

What I would suggest is don't look for a VPN unless you really need to encrypt your traffic.

Netflix/YouTube, huge consumers of data, talk over encrypted HTTP (HTTPS). Your government and ISP see a garbled mess via. HTTPS but also see that it is too and from usually Google/YouTube/NetFlix/etc. registered locations (IP's). You can find a VPN provider that uses a unique configuration that makes it looks like you are talking over HTTPS instead of the usual VPN related communications paths. If you have a ton of traffic to a server in North America/Europe over HTTPS that is not Google/YouTube/Netflix, it might raise a flag, though. Imagine you transferred 100GB to my computer in the USA this last month with all of it being encrypted data (in a fake VPN server scenario). It would be questioned and maybe looked into.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother issue you might run into, is that to establish a VPN connection there's a handshake involved that might be apparent a VPN connection was established, but everything beyond is gibberish. It would be a similar exchange as HTTPS before it establishes an encrypted connection, but the initial data might have a 'signature' or fit a standard VPN connection starting up. You need to pass a username/password to the VPN server, and the VPN server allows the connection. That exchange might be monitored for and the only behavior that fit the exchange is a VPN connection starting up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy opinion - pick your battle. People crap all over governments that want 'backdoors' in encryption and want to monitor everything - VPN, encrypted messaging on phones, social media. It tends to fall apart eventually (except China where people are sheeple). If you feel you still want to use a VPN, it's at your own risk but I assume unless you are clearly being mischievous they probably aren't going to make an example of you, just slap your wrist. I think the first year or so even if you are caught you can say 'oh, I didn't know, so sorry'!",

What I'm saying is, if you're just looking to do something like watch porn, is it worth the risk of prison time or a hefty fine or whatever the punishments are?\n\nIf it is and you still want to go through with this, then I recommend you use TOR. Specifically the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) with the use of a [pluggable transport](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/). If you want to go further than that, there's also [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/) or [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/) \\+ [Qubes](https://www.qubes-os.org/).\n\nTOR is better than VPNs if you have the government against you for a number of reasons including the fact that you could mask your traffic and that it eliminates the risk that a VPN provider might turn against you and give your information to your government.\n\nWorth noting that TOR also has it's disadvantages and may not be suitable for some situations, but if it's just browsing and/or messaging, it is perfect. Be sure to read all the documentations of each service. It's all long, but if you're going to be doing this then you need to read it otherwise you might get caught by a simple mistake you did.",

Googled the username of a certain twitter user and had a browse of a few nsfw pics (nothing illegal or too dodgy!) \n\nGlanced at my phone and realised I’m on WiFi not 4G. Freaked out and panicked. Closed the tabs and disconnected. Didn’t get any warning messages or anything to say I’d accessed a blocked site. It’s a public WiFi at work used by staff and general public so potentially huge amounts of users, with no log on info or passwords needed. My phone is just called “iPhone”. \n\nEven stupider that I have a vpn that I usually use and didn’t have this switched on. \n\nI’m assuming that no one will probably notice this given nothing flagged up (and I’m assuming that because they are HTTPS this gives some degree of encryption? But I may be wrong!) but can anyone give me any reassurance? I’ve got some fairly epic OCD and I can’t get the thought out of my head about losing my jobs. \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "description": "So I was stuck on this and finally solved it 10 minutes ago after agonizing over it for days and wanted to share what my problem was in case others have the same problem. The problem sounds ridiculous but the solution made a lot of sense. \n\nI noticed whenever I used \"duplicate\", \"extend\", or \"second screen only\" for windows project (Windows key + p), my internet speed would slow down a lot. I'm downloading GTA V on Steam and could see the download speed go from 20MB/sec to 7MB/sec when switching to the second monitor, then it would go back to 20MB/sec after I switched to \"PC screen only\". I saw a similar decrease when testing speeds with Ookla. \n\nThe solution was replacing the HDMI cable for my second monitor. I'm using wifi on my PC and apparently the old HDMI cable was probably causing interference. When I switched to a new HDMI cable (which seemed thicker and more shielded) I could use the second monitor without losing any speed on my download. \n\nJust to be sure, I switched back to the old cable and used the 2nd monitor, and still saw the decrease in speed. I went back to the new cable, and saw no decrease. \n\nThe old HDMI cable was a really old cable from General Electric, and it kinda makes sense that it caused issues. \n\nAnyways I hope this post is helpful for those with a similar issue!",

            "description": "Hopefully this is the right place; I've tried posting this to r/autocad but no help. I 110% did not cheat and what I submitted was my own work that I created yesterday during the exam time. Specifically, we were using the most recent version of AutoCAD electrical. I have not been able to get more information, but he alleged that the file was created in 2013. when I check the metadata for the files on my end, it shows it was created December 11th, 2023. The only weird thing is that it says it was created at 9pm and last modified at 6pm of the same day. What couldvl've caused it to say my file was created in 2013 on his end apparently but not mine? A few friends have suggested it couldve been a bit flip? I checked the Autodesk website and it appears that a file from 2013 AutoCAD Electrical would be incompatible with the most recent version.\nAdditionally, I did this exam on a school computer and the C: drive dumps itself as soon as you power off, so I'm not sure if access to previous versions of the file is an option or not. I saved the files to my OneDrive. Not sure if this is relevant, but the computer I used was a Dell optiplex 780 small form factor on windows 11.\n\nUpdate!! this has been resolved! He was really chill about it and apologized for the error. He will mark my submission. Apparently it was showing 2013 for a handful of different students, when he reopened my file on a different computer it didn't show 2013 for my file anymore, but it still did for another student. I'm not too sure what caused it, but as long I'm not getting a 0 and an academic integrity citation I'm good. thought it would be good have a list of possible causes for this just in case it needed to be escalated further, thankfully i need to though. thanks for your help everyone!",

I then ran Avast anti virus to see if there was anything on my computer that’s was malicious, it said it was all clear. \n\nA few moments later, that guy that I downloaded the file from, sent my IP address to me (which was the wrong one as I had a VPN on and had wired my connection somewhere else). He must have been using an ip grab url or something. I managed to chat to him and look through his Reddit page, turns out he is 14 years old from the US. He told me the virus would fill up my hard drive, but that isn’t happening for me because I switched my computer off so fast (I think). \n\nI figured this is probably a shitty bash script that hooked into discord and sent some random messages so I’m not thinking much more of it, but my question to my tech friends is, could this script still be running? Or has it been downloaded anywhere on my computer? Can it still do harm? Better to be safe than sorry. Guess it’s my fault for downloading untrusted downloads. \n\nThanks for your time guys, really appreciate it.",

            "description": "\nSo I have a piece of software that myself and my other dev have been building for the last 4 months. \n\nEarlier today, he was working on fixing a few bugs that kept popping up. Our hopes were to launch this software as an SaaS product. \n\nWe have an updater module sewed into the starting function that checks as soon as the program opens whether or not changes have been made to the software on the server side of things. If it detects that changes have been made, it will proceed to update the software automatically until it matches that of the server version. \n\nWell earlier he had made some changes, added them to github and updated the server accordingly. I open the software executable itself to conduct a UI test and the software goes ahead and starts updating. However, I instantly start getting notifications from Windows Defender warning me of threats that have just been discovered. Clicking on it, I see two files of high severity labeled as trojan malware. \n\nI instantly go to malware bytes and start running a scan while frantically moving my important files onto google drive before deleting them. \n\nUltimately, I’ve had about 47 detected malware files when a few weeks ago, I had zero. I ran the scan an additional 3 times until I had 0 suspicious files and the rest have been placed into quarantine. \n\nTypically, my OPSEC is on-point but I really wasn’t expecting my half-owned piece of software to suddenly launch an attack on me. I’m not sure whether my other dev was behind this but we’ve had a good working relationship for several months now, working 60 hour weeks together. I’m not sure why he’d suddenly turn around and purposely try to infect me as the only other user of this software. \n\nPerhaps our AWS server got hacked into, with someone embedding a bunch of malware into our code but that seems quite unlikely as well given that we’ve kept it under lock quite diligently. \n\nIt seems that the attack has already occured and even if it was stopped in its tracks ahead of time, my computer is likely compromised forever now. \n\nNot sure what to do now. This happened within the last hour and I’ve yet to hear from the other dev.\n\n***UPDATE: So I took a more in-depth look at some of these quarantined files and many of them were derived from a “Trojan: Win32/Wacatac.B!ml” file, meaning they were picked up by a ML script and could very well be false positives. \n\nThe other dev replied saying that it’s likely a direct result of our obfuscator to keep the software safe from reverse engineering. Apparently, his anti-virus software didn’t pick up anything. \n\nI’m still very much confused by as to why the defender suddenly categorized our obfuscator as a threat today when it’s been installed onto our software for a month and a half now. Why all of a sudden, after this menial update, would it instantly assume the software is malicious?\n\nI ran the files through VirusTotal and some of the files have been marked as malicious by several companies. \n\nGridinsoft reported “Trojan.Heur!.03013681” \n\nMcAfee reported “BehavesLike.Win32.Generic.rc”\n\nCyberreason reported “malicious.45350d”\n\nCylance just said “unsafe”\n\nThe other dev said the files acted trojan-like because the updater kept trying to install it whereas my anti-virus was quarantining them as soon as they arrived, supposedly giving them the appearance of replicating. \n\nI’m honestly not sure what the hell to think at this point. Even if it’s not actually malicious, I can’t foresee how we could ever monetize and distribute this software if it’s being regarded by several antivirus companies as being unsafe and harmful.\n\n***UPDATE #2: Thank you guys for all your valuable insights. \n\nI think I can say with 97% certainty that this was in fact a false positive due to several potential functions. \n\n1. As u/putarda pointed out, is the updater module itself. It actually made me rethink the process through which we’ll be updating our software in its entirety. What initially was meant to act as a fool-proof design to ensure nothing goes out of order actually ended up being a major security flaw. \n\nIf we had already been distributing this software and something of this nature occured and was NOT a false positive, this could’ve ended really, REALLY badly for all parties involved. To have the updater automatically install and overwrite files as soon as the executable is launched is just asking for trouble. From now on, updates will only be rolled out once the user manually confirms they want to update the software, ensuring they have a chance to test and confirm that the overwriting of files isn’t malicious in nature. \n\n2. It appears that the theory with the obfuscator is also correct. The issue that arises with the confuser modules is that every time one compiles the executable, it returns a completely new piece of code, even when the base code itself has undergone zero changes. It appears that there’s a matter of luck involved as to whether the AVs will actually brand it as a threat depending on how the end result actually looks like. \n\nAnd 3., as u/vermyx and u/accidentannual pointed out, the primary reason behind the antivirus flags is because we hold no legitimate license and are unrecognized as a trusted software provider. Without the digital signature, I think there’s very little we can actually do without completely severing the connection to our server (which would render our licensing system completely useless and updates unviable) and removing our obfuscator (which would mean our source code can be easily replicated and subsequently stolen). \n\nNeither of these scenarios sound particularly appealing so it seems that we’ll be needing to contact each of the AVs and requesting that they whitelist our product each time we add an update and recompile the software. It honestly sounds like a major pain in the ass but after scrounging the internet, it does seem like we’re not only ones being affected by this. NiceHash pleads with their clients to whitelist their software in Windows Defender as soon as they download and some of our competitors do so as well. \n\nAlthough, if I’m being perfectly honest, if I were a consumer being told by the devs issuing you your software to disregard any potential virus flares,  I’d be insanely sketched out and would likely never download any of their products. How we’re gonna get around this, I’ve yet to fully figure out but hopefully we’ll find a solution soon. \n\nIf this has showed me anything, it’s that the AVs weren’t necessarily wrong to warn users of the potential threat. At the end of the day, we’re a pretty low-budget SaaS that could easily have our product become compromised and become malware despite intending to be a clear-cut piece of software. \n\nWe’ll be implementing the changes over the coming weeks and submitting the final compile to each of the AVs as soon as we’ve done so.\n\nThank you all for the advice!",

To windows defender all files are important and it doesn't know if you are trying to harm files or to just update them. It doesn't know if those files that you are trying to overwrite/create belong to your software's directory. Suspicious programs are watched by windows defender and your is probably under its watch. Do you have a license on your software? Because if you don't want this to happen to anyone else you must have it. It costs to register and requires information about your company but it is a guarantee for windows that you are not going to mess up with the user files because if you do they will know for who to look for.\n\nEDIT:\nAnd to add, did your friend compile that software? Because if he did, that explains why his anti virus didn't recognize it as a threat.

Years ago, I worked with a game engine which would do this quite a lot. Many commerical anti-virus programs at the time would report .exes created by the game engine as being malicious, which was a problem for devs, because they had to tell their users to add exceptions, etc.\n\nCould you ask your coworker to run the same software that you ran on their own system? Under the same conditions? That would indicate that the anti-virus is triggering on your software.\n\nIf that is the case, you could approach the company who makes the anti-virus software and ask them to add an exception for your app. I believe this is possible, but I'm not sure what the procedure is.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you could rewrite or remove the code obfuscator? There's an old saying which I'm sure you're aware of \"security through obscurity is no security at all\", so this feature may not be necessary, and you're right, if you're software produces a ton of virus warnings, you will have huge trouble releasing it commercially.",

This should soon establish you as alpha of the local subnet.",

Use it when you need, plug in when you don’t, and don’t worry about it. \n\nThere was a time when you needed to fully charge/discharge and unplug once charging was done in order to maximize battery life but that time is long gone. For some reason that advice is stuck forever in the public consciousness though.",

Inside there was just a text file called “Not\\_a\\_virus.json.txt” which just said hehehe. The folder had not been modified since January. I have not run an antivirus since discovering it but have run many between January and now. What steps should I take moving forward?\n\nEdit: I never really found out how it got there, but after doing full scans with every antivirus I could think of, I got no detections. Like I said in the comments, no one else has access to my computer as I live alone. My best theory is that it was part of some legit file I downloaded and added as a joke or as part of some games' story. Thank you all for the help and I didn't expect this dumb post to get so much attention.",
