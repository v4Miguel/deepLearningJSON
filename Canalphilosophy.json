It describes an observation of what seems to be gong on. It's people witnessing a certain pattern of thinking or social conditions.  The concept doesn't get into *why* people choose to do it (or if there is free will to choose). An ancient Greek example of *why* would be more like Plato's Allegory of the [Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69F7GhASOdM).",

                "comment": "Meta:  I have to wonder how many of the people who are upvoting this (probably almost entirely without reading it) are doing so because they believe it describes their ideological opponents, and without considering the likelihood that their rush to upvote this without reading it is really a pretty vivid illustration of how it describes themselves.\n\nAnd an edit to add an additional meta:  I wrote this before I read through the rest of the thread and noted that many of the responses right here on this thread are just what I was considering - they obviously think that this is referring to their ideological opponents, but by simply blithely making that unsupported assertion, they're actually demonstrating that it likely applies to them.\n\n>[S]ince the \u2018higher stupidity\u2019 consists not in an inability to understand but in a refusal to understand, any healing or reversal of it will not occur through rational argumentation, through a greater accumulation of data and knowledge, or through experiencing new and different feelings \u2026 We may say that the reversal of a spiritual sickness must entail a spiritual cure.\n\nThat's exactly why the one thing I won't tolerate in a debate is intellectual dishonesty.  I have no particular issue with people who misinterpret what I'm trying to say - I'm more than willing to explain further.  But when it becomes apparent that they're not misinterpreting it, but misrepresenting it, I have no interest in continuing, at all, and that specifically because those people cannot be reached.  There's no combination of words and ideas that are going to get through to them because it's not that they aren't grasping the idea, but that they will not even consider it.\n\n>Amathia = \u2018disknowledge\u2019 instilled into the soul by bad upbringing and bad education, consisting in false values and notions and beliefs.\n\nWhile it likely plays a role in at least most cases, and might well be the primary cause in many cases, I don't think that \"bad upbringing and bad education\" is really at the heart of this.  I mean - I guess a case might be made that it is insofar as people aren't brought up or educated to avoid this trap, but I think the trap is primarily psychological, so it's a bit more fundamental than what is generally thought of as \"upbringing\" and \"education.\"\n\nI would say that, and rather obviously really, the thing that most consistently leads to amathia is identification with a particular viewpoint.  That's really the key, and that's the thing that needs to be avoided in order to avoid amathia.\n\nWhat I mean by that:\n\nThere's essentially a hierarchy of ways in which one can approach ideas.  From best to worst:\n\n1) By considering the merits and likelihood of individual ideas.\n\n2) By believing in the validity of one idea.\n\n3) By holding one broad position.\n\n4) By identifying with one ideology.\n\nAt each stage, there's additional psychological investment in a position regarding the idea, and it's that psychological investment that, in my opinion, really drives amathia (and is the primary factor behind the hierarchy).  That is exactly how and why intelligent people come to hold destructive and invalid ideas - simply because they have a stake in them.  It's not just a matter of considering ideas and weighing their merits and likelihood, but of maintaining a self-image.  By the time it gets to the point at which people have defined themselves as \"____ists,\" the idea is no longer even the primary consideration - they are overtly no longer talking about the idea, but about themselves - the idea is secondary at best.\n\nAnd it's as that psychological investment grows that people become more likely to engage in the sort of intellectual dishonesty that characterizes amathia.  That is, I would say, the real driving force.\n\nAnd again, it might be argued that upbringing and education can and should counter that, but it seems to me that, at best, we're a considerable distance from being able to even begin to accomplish that.  It's going to require some fundamental changes in the human psyche and in human civilization, such that people no longer feel such a need to invest themselves in positions - to stake some part of their self-images on the wearing of an ideological label.\n\n>You may be familiar with philosopher Hannah Arendt\u2019s famous description of what most Nazi bureaucrats did as the \u201cbanality of evil.\u201d She was criticized for that phrase...\n\nI've never looked into it closely, but I had no idea that she was criticized for that.  I've always thought it was rather insightful - that it neatly pointed out what seemed to me to be obviously true - that the Nazis were not some sort of EEE-vil supervillains, but just more or less ordinary people, caught up in a particularly nasty sort of irrationality.  Just as is the case with other people in admittedly generally (but not always) more mundane and less destructive contexts, they were invested in an ideology, and employing whatever intellectual dishonesty was necessary to protect their self-images.\n\n>I suggest, not just to my fellow Stoics, but to anyone interested in ethics and the human condition, that we should resurrect the word \u201camathia,\u201d just like we have resurrected \u201ceudaimonia,\u201d because it is a crucial concept for which \u2014 interestingly \u2014 there is no adequate English translation, or comparable concept in the English language.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that it should be resurrected, and I'd only add that I'm enough of a cynic that I sort of chuckle over the mild observation that there's \"interestingly\" no adequate English translation.  I would've been tempted to use something more pointed there, like \"conveniently\" or even \"likely not accidentally,\" since I'd say that it's rather obvious that there are a great many people who achieve and hold positions of power and privilege *specifically* by taking advantage of the human proclivity for amathia.\n\nI'll definitely do my part to resurrect the term.  Much of the focus of my thinking over the years has been the ways in which, and the reasons why, people limit and cripple their own thinking, but even with that, I'd never before encountered the word \"amathia.\"  It will certainly become a part of my vocabulary.",

If a person has never known true objectivity (arguably none have btw), then that person is dealing with agonia. How can a person who is ignorant of right knowingly do wrong? If presented with multiple choices, one of which is \"correct\", how can an ignorant person reliably choose wisely? It seems as if their choice wouldn't be random but would be based on the experiences set into memory. If those experiences do not instill wisdom, then it is up to the individual to break their own chains and exit the cave on their own. To the ignorant man, the voices of wisdom and ignorance are indistinguishable. So I'm not sure that there is such a thing as willful ignorance or intelligent stupidity. It seems as if those who seem intelligent yet embrace wrong decisions are in a very crucial way ignorant of the correct path.",

Merely that (provided someone is not literally insane or suffering from a mental disorder) there is thought put into what they do.\n\nThe crux of the quote came down to how to better connect with people and understand their motivations and why they do what they do. In the case of something like amathia, it would be incorrect to assume the person doing something wrong is doing it because they're stupid or don't understand. But instead look at their decision making factors and decide WHY they do it.\n\nThis could easily be made into practice by looking at why people do things that harm their body (smoke, drink excess, drugs, etc). It's not that they don't know the harmful effects, and it's not that they're stupid, but there is a rational decision making process going on where they're saying \"I get more benefit from doing this thing that brings me happiness, for this deep seated reason I'm feeling\". \n\nIn the vein of this thread, they're refusing to look at the reality of their choices and the information they know to make the BEST educated decision, yet they refuse to accept that concrete logic and instead default to the things that make them feel good or feel better about themselves.",

                "comment": "I think a lot of this can stem from believing in a broad ideology and refusing to acknowledge an idea that goes against your ideology. For example, most libertarians/conservatives believe that the free market is the solution to nearly all market based problems, while liberal democrats believe the free market is the best solution for many, but not all market based problems. On the other end, communists believe the free market is the best solution to very few or no market based problems. I would argue though that the conservative stance and the communist stance is far more ideological since this mean that a libertarian/conservative will be skeptical to a fault when it comes to non free market based solutions and communists will be skeptical to a fault when it comes to free market based solutions. Liberals will be less likely to be unnecessarily skeptical of either since they believe either free market or non free market solutions may be applicable. \n      \nTake for example healthcare. There is clear empiric evidence that the US system costs more money and produces worse outcomes than any other developed nations government funded healthcare systems. Yet conservatives refuse to entertain any bill that attempts to let the government intervene in healthcare on a mass scale, despite conservatives being generally supportive of more accessible healthcare and equitable healthcare outcomes. The free market ideology blinds them from looking at non free market solutions. *Edit: on the other hand liberals generally support free trade, a free market solution, but also support socialized medicine.      \n      \nNow of course there are areas where liberals are more ideological than conservatives, but when it comes to economic issues the conservative ideology prevents many of them from empirically looking at evidence that goes against it. Basically they start with the solution (the free market fixes everything), and discount immediately any and all other solutions.     \n      \n*Edit: There is actually fairly compelling evidence that liberal areas of the country produce superior economic outcomes. In 2000, [659 counties voted for Gore that accounted for 54% of the GDP](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/11/29/another-clinton-trump-divide-high-output-america-vs-low-output-america/), in 2016, 472 counties voted for Clinton that accounted for 64% of GDP. You also see better healthcare outcomes in liberal states. In 2017, McKinsey and Company produced a report on the [states with the best healthcare outcomes](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/health-care). Of the top 10 best performing states, 9 voted for Clinton, of the 10 worst performing states, all voted for Trump.",

You could say \"always cooperate\" the first time, but what if they do something horrible and you don't get a second chance to \"copycat\"?  And would you risk you family?     \n  \n  I used to pick up hitchikers all the time, and even let near strangers sleep at my apartment, gave them some money and feed them.

The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start. Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result, this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.\n\nSOURCE: [Wikipedia: Prisoners Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoner.27s_dilemma)",

Reputation allows you to better predict who you can trust and who you cannot, either from personal experience or from observing others. Anonymity negates reputation and makes what might be a very long game into individual games, which tends to favor defecting over cooperating.\n\nHowever, for a similar reason anonymity is vital to a free speech and a free society -- you can speak openly about subjects that would anger many people, only when anonymous. On the other hand, that also allows for trolling and other unwanted speech, that can drown out the constructive speech. But conversely can prevent unwanted reputation-based flaws such as virtue signalling/karma whoring, and flamewars and dismissing people with the wrong reputation rather than looking at what they said, all of which can also drown out good conversation.\n\nThere's also the compromise: pseudo-anonymity, such as granted by usernames or cryptographic signatures. Very useful for the internet where anything you say might accidentally offend thousands, but you want to reduce trolling. You can build a reputation but can abandon it should it go far negative.",

It's a great way I think to engage people who just might want to play an interactive game and might not otherwise be interested in the philosophical aspects.\n\nI wrote up my first thoughts and response while playing if anyone wants to compare:\n\nFirst character: Of course you cooperate. You have everything to lose by leading with a cheat. Turns out they're friendly and so you risk being cheated once and it pays off with you both winning.\n\nSecond character: Oh god that hat. Definitely going to cheat. Oh well, prove me wrong.  Nope. Fine. Cheat the rest of the way and they can take their awful taste in hats and fuck off.\n\nThird: Well, if I lead with a cheat it's a dick move, but at least I won't lose again. Maybe they'll give me a second chance - they do have a nice hat. As it turns out, yes. Thank you for being awesome and letting my shit slide once.\n\nFourth character: Should I lead with a cheat and hope for a repeat or should I cooperate until they give me reason not to? I don't like their hat. We will say cooperate, and if he reciprocates, then on the very last round, cheat just to be a troll. I got a good laugh when it worked.\n\nFinal character: Not sure, cooperate at first. That worked out, but then second round, they cheated, so naturally cheat back. But then switch back to cooperating, so fine, let's cooperate finally. \n\nEnded up with 40 points. I'll take it, I have no regrets!",

Elementary, my dear Watson.\n\nWhy do game theorists seem to very often just assume that all people are selfish AF, with no concern for others, when empirically people demonstrate a [preference for fairness](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=human+preference+fairness&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwikzYqh7avVAhXF7yYKHVPsBKsQgQMIJDAA)? I'm aware of the difference between defining economic rationality and philosophical rationality, but too often there is a habit of lazily falling back on the assertion that self-interest = selfishness. This is not the case, and any decent discussion of game theory and its potential ramifications for ethics should certainly make sure to clarify the distinction.\n\n>Now, let's let our population of players evolve over time.\n\nAnd now we can add some evopsych nonsense to the mix. The text states outright that cooperative people are \"losers\", and will be \"eliminated\", and yet once again there is no basis for that claim. People are willing to help one another, often at great personal expense, even when they know there will be no material benefit for doing so. Game theorists seem to focus on economic examples precisely because that ignores the complexities of their relationships outside of exchange. If life worked on the incredibly reductive model shown, those behaviors would have been \"bred out\" over our thousands of years of implementing game-theoretical evolutionary strategies. This is obviously not the case.\n\nTL;DR- game theory is a shit way of approaching morality.",

One of the things we studdied was game theory and things like the prisoners delima. Our \"exam\" for the unit was a game, a simple game. Everyone could choose A or B, if everyone chose B, everyone failed the unit and got no points. If everyone chose A, everyone passed the unit with the normal amount of points (it was a points added grade system). However, if even one person chose B, and at least one berson chose A, then the person(s) who chose A would get no points, and the person(s) who chose B got double the points. I sat there, listening to everyone discuss, and I came to a conclusion- it would be easier and better for future interactions with my class if I chose A, and let them all know that I had, and that they should choose B. So I did. It was interesting.\n\nI bring this up because between this fun game, and my experience in college, I have had the concept of game theory driven home. I like the point that was made about multiple games being important, because while I may have thrown one game, I did it to increase my odds in others to follow, so overall it was neat.",

Tit-for-Tat is \"Cooperate\" until someone \"Defects\" and then you \"Defect\" **once** and return to Cooperate.  CopyCat is doesn't have the \"once\" part but there is a bootstrapping issue with your first play if you are iterative but not N-->\u221e where Tit-for-Tat has \"communication advantages\" as a 2nd order effect.  But either is better than the rest!\n\nThe part I found \"foul\" when I learned this in MBA school was that there's another game called \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" which usually suggests \"Defection is optimal\".  This was proven by Nash (of \"Beautiful Mind\" fame).  BUT PD is **only a single play game where you NEVER see or play your opponent ever again**.  \n\nFor example Cold War MADD was Prisoner Dilemma with Nash Criteria BUT you can only play that once - the world is destroyed after one play of Defect.  \n\nThe \"foul\" part in my MBA was that once most people heard about Nash Criteria and how \"defecting\" *could sometimes be optimal*, they stopped listening to the lecture and ignored the part of it being a \"single play\" game only.  Their eyes glazed over in an ecstasy of \"mathematically justified greed\" except NOPE, that's not even wrong!!\n\nSo in economics or business, just when would PD be correct?   Clearly in cases when you never see the other party ever again and never play again.  \n\nSo the one scenario I use: imagine you are on vacation on the other side of the world and while wandering in some unknown corner or some unknown city, a street urchin comes up to sell you a carved wooden elephant - that is PD territory.  He'll be playing it that way and perhaps you should also.  \n\nBut, in the course of most normal business, single-play **NEVER happens**.  There is a societal and economic memory to anything you do.   Communities, even in corporate American are *tiny* and what you do will always follow you.  And with the Internet, that's even more true.  \n\nSo the reality is that most business is iterated, and thus the correct play is actually \"mostly\" cooperative!  Either \"Tit-for-Tat\" or \"Copy Cat\".  \n\nAnyone who has an MBA and says \"Greed is Good; You should screw everyone!!\", was not paying attention in Game Theory class and probably you should \"short\" their business talents over the longer run.  They don't know what they are talking about.\n\n",

But as we saw, with different values, always-cheat can be the winner too. So would they say, then we should all be always-cheat in real life? No, they would rather say: Then we have to try to change the parameters.\n\nIf a kid is drowning, and you will never see that kid or their parents etc. ever again in life, game theory (as it is only about personal profit) tells you: Don't save that kid's life, because you getting wet clothes is not worth it as they can't pay you back. We are better than that though, and most people would not think like that and would save the kid.\n\nOr, different example: Game theory tells you, if you can cheat and nobody will notice, you should always cheat. That's the \"logical\" thing to do, but that doesn't mean it's the right thing. If you can steal a beggars coins without anyone noticing, would you? No, obviously most people would not.

For example, if everyone else scores highly in Dark Triad traits, it becomes logical for you to also develop similar traits. However, if everyone else is an empath who scores low in Dark Triad traits, it's better for everyone (including you) to be an empath. If there is great variance in the amount of Dark Triad traits across a population, it raises a moral and logical dilemma in the individual who is now faced with a decision of how to behave.\n\nIn summary, Dark Triad traits are beneficial to an individual in a competitive environment for short term success with minimal short term losses, but these are detrimental to the \"game\" in the long run, and encourage others to be equally competitive and selfish.\n\nIn a system where empaths reward other empaths more than non-empaths reward other non-empaths, there becomes a greater incentive for empathy to develop.",

Even though there appears to be a trend of ongoing social isolation, that can also be an issue of the question used, as it is not ideal for eliciting the actual personal networks.

The irony and self-congratulation in this thread is nauseatingly missing the point though.\n\nIf you think you've got solutions to universal problems, realize that your complete inability to roll out those solutions proves you haven't got a clue.  You spend time circle jerking each other about how right you are and that the problem is someone's ideology or mindset or some other garbage.  You're just not convincing and are easily dismissed by others because you're more interested in living in the same self-deluded bubble as everyone else.  You don't have compassion and a desire to help others, only to feel smarter than them which is extraordinarily transparent.\n\nEveryone has the same blind spot because they have one human experience to draw upon: their own.  They think they're different than others or the same as others exclusively when it suits their internal narrative.  But that's all it is, a narrative, built on a false premise that, in a world of 7 billion people, we are special.  It's a new narrative that has grown with the rise of the individual and it had a useful upside: we became curious instead of complacent. We had humility but felt powerless the middle ages.  Now we're curious, empowered by our individuality but are no longer humble.\n\nSadly our new self-assuring narrative is created early in life and is hard to break.  It becomes a filter that is so immediately applied to our thoughts as to be nearly subconscious.  That doesn't mean it can't be broken down and replaced by something better but it's a deep personal challenge, more difficult than giving up an addiction.  You could call it the greatest addiction as so many people suffer so deeply from it.  It's also not a new idea, a number of religions and philosophies have been founded for thousands of years on differing principles all pointing to the same desired outcome.  Each trying to point people to the same flaw and its solution.\n\nYou want an educational revolution?  Maybe focus on thinking critically about yourselves instead of touting how brilliant you are.  You might become a smarter, happier, more influential person and someone else just might notice and want to hear how you got to where you are.  Enough people do that and things will change.  As of right now?  You're still just part of the same old problem.",

The teachers who taught me were steeped in the ideology that the most important things in education were to teach critical thinking and to teach kids how to learn and investigate topics for themselves.  Not just the younger ones but most of the older ones as well, the ones who got their teaching degrees thirty years before I was born.  Just ordinary public school teachers in a poor rural school district who accepted what they were taught about education in school.  This \"revolution\" has already happened and we are enjoying the benefits right now.\n\nI feel like I have to make the same point over and over again on Reddit when people suggest educational \"reforms\" based on ideas that have been orthodoxy for half a century.  I think the root cause of this phenomenon is that people process their memories of middle and high school as if they weren't an idiot when they formed them.  I just saw a trailer for a new TV show centered around a middle school.  In it, the principal drops a book of poetry into a trash can and announces that creativity is not allowed in his school.  Of course there isn't a single school official at any level in the entire United States who would do such a thing, even if they wanted to.  Creativity and critical thinking are sacred and not even the grinchiest principal would dare to question them out loud.  A principal declaring that creativity is not allowed in his school is not reality; it's how a twelve year old perceives reality.  If you could go back in time and meet your school teachers now, you would find out that many of them were exactly the kind of progressive educators you think would have made such a difference for you.  Not that they were all great teachers.  They were just ordinary people working a job that not all of them were good at.  But by and large they agreed with progressive educational ideals because those ideals were accepted into the mainstream long, long ago.\n\ntl;dr You can't base a \"revolution\" on ideas that have been orthodoxy for generations.\n",

All this playing around with premises and conclusion is almost never helpful, as while failure in logic can happen, they are rather trivial nature and easily correct.

Take something like this:\n\n> P1: Climate change is bad.\n>\n> P2: Bad things should be avoided\n>\n> ---------------------------------------\n>\n> C: We should avoid climate change\n\nLogically sound, but also completely useless. As it is a matter of degree. How bad will it get? How much will it cost to avoid it? How sure are we of our prediction and of our evidence. And so on. That's always where those logic games fall apart and why they are best just discarded. The real world is much too complicated to be summarized by oneliner premises.\n\nKnowing about [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), how to do double blinding and so on is much more impartant than playing useless logic games.\n\nSee [Here Be Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=752V173e31o) for a consumer friendly video on those topics.",

I was always disgusted in my first degree studying English and literature with how discouraged original ideas were. I wrote dozens of papers that were rejected or which I had to re-write because I could not find peer reviewed, academic sources about what I was writing. I used direct sources in books and history to write papers with original ideas instead of parroting the biased opinions of academia and was punished for doing so.\n\nThat all important business degree (which I have nearly completed) is all that matters...nevermind that business students are the most one-track-minded people on campus who cannot tackle a problem which falls outside the scope of their textbooks and lectures. Able to memorize concepts but unable to apply them to real world problems. I learned more in one semester of English/writing/research classes than I have in my entire business education.",

Young people need to know that most if not all of their opinions are going to be proven wrong eventually and there's no shame in that.

Additionally, depth and encouragement of critical thinking certainly needs to be improved upon in the States.

The very reason we live in such advanced times with luxurious technology is because people back up the road took their time to ask \"Why?\" and \"How?\" when it came to science and mathematics, rather than just \"Okay.\"",

A few of these complaints are essentially ad hominem criticisms: \"I can't take anyone who uses hashtags seriously.\" To learn more about ad hominem arguments and why we should avoid them, [check out our intro video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBkj-AYYg7w).\n\nBut other criticisms are more substantive, like \"hashtags represent a failure of critical thinking\" or \"your message is great, but hashtags undermine it\".\n\nWe think the use of this hashtag is fine, for a few reasons:\n\n- First, it's not clear what's so bad about hashtags, in general. Hashtags are rhetorical devices, for sure; and rhetoric without substance can be dangerous. But, as far as we can tell, this post has substance. And it hasn't encouraged mindless \"feelings\"-based engagement. You guys have generated some awesome, critical discussion here!\n\n- Second, this post has drawn a good deal of attention to an important cause. It's unclear whether the hashtag has contributed to the post's success, but we'd hardly say it's been detrimental.\n\n- Third, we think it's a pretty clever hashtag ;)\n\n\nCheers, reddit!

We have maintained above-average test scores in our area everywhere but the past five or six years, which have shown a steady decline in  standardized test scores and thus, a staunching of school funds; not to mention the state that I live in has not had a proper budget for a very long time at this point. Needless to say, we're broke.\n\nOne of the most recent standardized tests I can remember taking in school was called the PARCC, and it was dreaded by our district. Schools in our area did horribly on this test, to the point where som layoffs occurred because of poor results. I took the test in the Math and English department last year, and I remember one thing very prominently about the whole experience; nobody, not even the teachers, cared.\n\nWe went through about three weeks of training for the test, where we practiced curricula I had never learned, and that seemed far above my level to learn. I've taken every advanced class available to me and have tried to learn as much as possible from said classes, but I didn't understand well over half of the test. When I asked what I was going to do, I was unanimously responded with \"Try your Best.\"\n\nI later realized that the reason our faculty cared so little about the test was because it was being de-legitimized by teaching unions to the point where results likely would not matter. So, when test day came around, I tried my best. My results showed that, while I did poorly (as expected), I did far better than nearly every other student at my school, including ones in calculus and other higher classes. Why? Because nobody cared.\n\nI feel like a similar apathy is prominent in education; to the point where teachers do what they must to maintain their job and little more. That same math teacher who cared so little got a master's in statistics and immediately moved to a much better school, where they were being payed well over double what our district offered, and she had added benefits. While I do not have any knowledge of the struggles or issues this person faced, my experience told me they did not deserve to be teaching any higher classes when all they cared about was maintaining scores, to the point where she didn't even teach us more than we absolutely needed to pass the class.\n\nTo avoid more personal spite, I'll close; in my own personal experience, critical thinking and personal growth mean NOTHING to some educators. The United States does so little to reward proper teaching and so much to punish bad test scores that educators are forced to teach memorization, not thought.",

Of course that something is often flawed itself. And there are many different groups pushing for different beliefs.\n\nReal critical thinking skills are going to be unpleasant to most large groups, because it will result in people that question beliefs you hold dear. It won't result in reafirmation of the views liked the most here, or in a discussion akin to what happens to reddit's lefty echochambers which is no discussion at all.\n\nI overwhelmingly support genuine critical thinking skills development but I suspect that due to the above facts the old \"push the propaganda that agrees with us and call it critical thinking\" is more in line with what is actually wanted. And I am not referring to the videos linked in the OP but more about the discussion. Sure, those can be a part of critical thinking skills, but it isn't enough. You need to question whether the education system also pushes propaganda against critical thinking skills, and reexamine beliefs popular among your side.\n\nThis is actually somewhat terrifying because a flawed worldview full of bullshit is concluded or alluded to be the result of critical thinking development. This creates obstacles to even question that worldview and creates a big problem of lack of critical thinking. Because the obvious obstacle to critical thinking. \n\nIntelligence in itself isn't going to necessarily protect people, especially ones brainwashed through birth by an ideology that managed to become dominant. In fact most extremist but successful for a time in a certain society ideologies, managed to get a great deal of intelligent people in their society on their side. The problem is ideological indoctrination and cognitive dissonance of going against what you have consider true for a long time, and is also socially pressured to consider true.\n\nSo, the freedom to go against dogmas and intellectual humility of considering the flaws of the dogmas popular by one or different side, is a key aspect of critical thinking.\n\nIt is also important that echochambers are less popular, so people aren't strongly motivated to follow a script or be hated and banned. \n\nThat feelthelearn hashtag is also an unfortunate and likely intentional association with one politician which it would be a very controversial statement to claim that his views are the perfect result of critical thinking on a variety of issues.\n\nAlso, things aren't as simple as black and white. People who buy into certain bullshit often display some critical thinking skills that lead them to disagree with a major popular but flawed narrative. And unfortunately they adopt their own side's bullshit. It would be an inaccurate conclusion that betrays lack of critical thinking skills to consider the OTHER side (and of course your OWN side) completely lacking in critical thinking skills.\n\n",

It's great to see some critical engagement with this topic (some *critical thinking critical thinking* - heh heh).\n\nA few people have complained about our use of a hashtag (\"#FeelTheLearn\"). A few of these complaints are essentially ad hominem criticisms: \"I can't take anyone who uses hashtags seriously.\" To learn more about ad hominem arguments and why we should avoid them, [check out our intro video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBkj-AYYg7w).\n\nBut other criticisms are more substantive, like \"hashtags represent a failure of critical thinking\" or \"your message is great, but hashtags undermine it\".\n\nWe think the use of this hashtag is fine, for a few reasons:\n\n- First, it's not clear what's so bad about hashtags, in general. Hashtags are rhetorical devices, for sure; and rhetoric without substance can be dangerous. But, as far as we can tell, this post has substance. And it hasn't encouraged mindless \"feelings\"-based engagement. You guys have generated some awesome, critical discussion here!\n\n- Second, this post has drawn a good deal of attention to an important cause. It's unclear whether the hashtag has contributed to the post's success, but we'd hardly say it's been detrimental.\n\n- Third, we think it's a pretty clever hashtag ;)\n\n\nCheers, reddit!

It is seen as worthless because it does not clearly and directly translate into a lucrative career. That tells us a lot about our cultures relationship with knowledge and tells us why we are failing in lower level of education to make decisions which engender a more intelligent society. \n\nBut its not just critical thinking, science, research, and the like that we need to do better at. We also need to do a better job of teaching emotional intelligence. Understanding our selves as thinking, feeling human beings and the empathy and compassion of seeing others not as \"others\" but as not very dissimilar. \n\nI just dont know how we would go about creating a \"system\" of education which is legally sanctioned that can teach something ambiguous without a bunch of parents getting their panties in the bunch.

Does it include diseases that come with the body? What's your identity? Is it just your brain? Are you your brain?  \n\nThis is why I think this whole debate comes to a conflict and really just falls apart. Society as it is right now is generally setup for people with a common ground on what I is, or at least a tons of \"You\" which are similar enough/relatable enough where we could create a system of governance etc which works generally for everyone else also.  \n\nAs of now we can make a general claim that people generally who are \"Normal\" are consciousnesses/brains which consider themselves to have morals, they have constant memory of at least a couple years past, they experience emotion normally like love, hate, fear, etc (Or in other words, generally the same instinctive reactions to situations), overall however you would describe a \"Normal\" person. Even then this is so fuckin vague because I could go even deeper and discuss what part of the brain is really us or if it's all just a collective, but that would confuse everything, so let us stick to this basic definition. \n\nThis comes to conflict in my opinion though when you introduce people who are NOT of our general, relatable, mind set of what I is, they're born into a society which demands they behave like everyone else and expects them to be relatable like everyone else. But this proposes a problem, what if someone's \"you\"/\"i\" is not our general understanding on \"You\" or \"i\", what if just like this man, he has dementia and isn't really experiencing life with the same consciousness as everyone else, can we really judge him by our standards when our consciousness is essentially generally far different than theirs?  \n\nOf course we should have something to prevent him from killing after all this mindset might have set him off to behave like this. So I would instead recommend just prison(For life, you can't convince a different consciousness to behave like us, it's already setup differently), it keeps him away from society, killing him serves no purpose and is a waste of resources. \n\n",

Its a little like the gay wedding cakes. Its the only example used because in almost no other situation would you even no for sure if someone is gay. This discussion literally only applies to a very few extreme examples. ",

The date comes from the suggestion in the Crito that Socrates' execution was postponed until the arrival of a ritual ship several days after his conviction. The problem with this idea is that there is no other evidence that executions were ever delayed in this manner - in fact, they were usually pretty immediate. It is true that escape into exile was usually a possibility in capital cases, but this escape was supposed to occur *before* the sentence was passed - after sentencing, the execution was carried out immediately. \n\nIn other words, the ritual delay upon which the authority of this date rests is highly questionable. In fact, given the high degree of fictionalization which Plato uses in his discussions of Socrates, it seems to me obvious that the Crito is not an account of Socrates actual pre-execution philosophizing but rather a true work of fiction. This, again, shouldn't be surprising, since the figure of Socrates in the dialogues is always highly fictionalized and even at times allegorical. \n\nTl;dr the Socrates of the dialogues is always highly fictionalized for allegorical purposes. Ignore those who claim he is merely Plato's mouthpiece!",

For us Athenians, father of all Ionians--the true autochthonous people of Greece--have always been championed by Athena to be born natural freedmen and not as servile to some tyrant. If it was as old as you say it was... then Orestes wouldn't had gone to Athens to get a democratic jury to judge his matricide, as he did in *Eumenides*. \u201d\n\nThe sophist was visibly shaken, and dropped his parchment and copy of the Republic. He stormed out of the Gymnasium crying those sophist crocodile tears. The same tears oligarchs cry for the so-called \u201caristoi\u201c (who today live in such luxury that most own estates with at least 500 slaves) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving ordinary city state citizens. There is no doubt that at this point our youth-debauching teacher, Xenocrates, wished he had took up an education in some noble craft as his forefathers once did and become more than a sophist oligarch orator. He wished so much that he acquired hemlock to poison himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against such!\n\nThe Athenian citizens applauded and all registered for the new elections of magistrates that day and accepted Democracy as their lord and savior. An owl named \u201cSolon\u201d flew into the room and perched atop the pillar were the laws were written and shed a tear on the wax. The laws were read several times, and Athena herself showed up and enacted the planning for the construction 50 triremes. The sophist lost his citizenship and was ostracized the next day. He died of the plague sent to him by Apollo and was tossed into the river Styx for all eternity.\n\nThe hero\u2019s name? Thrasybulus.\n\nPs. Expand the Delian League",

When I get thoughts that seem out of place or go on a thought loop I take a deep breath. Meditation helps lower the volume of the addict in my brain.  The problem is, when you take away the drugs or alcohol, I'm still left with the addict part of my brain. If I don't change my thinking it will lead straight back to the drugs that put me on my ass in the first place. I learned this in the 12step rooms, and I learned this from my psychologist, and even my philosopher friend commented on it as well.  It will be a lifelong journey of trying to overcome the thinking that I believe to which I was genetically predisposed.

From the back cover: \"Why does American law allow the recreational use of some drugs, such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, but not others, such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin? The answer lies not simply in the harm the use of these drugs might cause, but in the perceived morality--or lack thereof--of their recreational use. Despite strong rhetoric from moral critics of recreational drug use, however, it is surprisingly difficult to discern the reasons they have for deeming the recreational use of (some) drugs morally wrong. In this book, Rob Lovering lays out and dissects various arguments for the immorality of using marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and other drugs recreationally. He contends that, by and large, these arguments do not succeed. Lovering's book represents one of the first works to systematically present, analyze, and critique arguments for the moral wrongness of recreational drug use. Given this, as well as the popularity of the morality-based defense of the United States' drug laws, this book is an important and timely contribution to the debate on the recreational use of drugs.\" ",

It is an induced network error in the reward/reinforcement circuitry of the nucleus accumbans shell-ventral tegmental area-hippocampus recurrent connections. Specifically of the projection neurons of the accumbans that express high levels of mu opioid receptor. \n\nWe evolved to find specific things naturally rewarding, as the author said, we want certain things. The most powerful natural rewards are things like water, food, sex, safety, and social status, all things likely to contribute to survival and procreation. Opiates literally alter gene expression patterns in this circuit such that it re-wires itself to prioritize the acquisition of opiates above all other rewards deemed important for life, sharply discounting everything else. \n\nIt can take months for the opiate upregulated transcription factor responsible for causing and maintaining the bad wiring to decay to baseline levels. That's why cravings and psychological changes persist for months after the acute physical withdraws have passed (acute withdrawals have to do with cell level changes to dopamine receptors which were reduced in number and made less sensitive as an attempt to maintain homeostasis, these receptor alterations recover within 5-10 days). \n\nBut knowledge is power. Recognizing it as a disease is an excellent first step. Recognizing exactly what has gone wrong and how to treat it is the next step. This is an extremely complex problem and neuroscience just isn't there yet. But there are thousands of researchers working on it all the time, it's not intractable. ",

The exception is of course on the relative moral weights of the actions. Eg, if you can guarantee a cure, but if requires the death of another person.. For the most part I'd say that realistic treatments will not cross this line.\n\nIf we care not for the addict but rather for society, then we either need to do what works, or we need to remove the addict from society. The latter is done half heartedly with prison time. Except that in prison the person still had a cozy to society and limited interaction. Also the person  will rejoin society at some point in most cases. So, again, we are left doing what works, or being morally deficient ourselves. \n\nIf we care not for society nor the addict, then we care for our own sake. The a arguments remain the same.\n\nSo then the only question becomes, what works? While it now becomes tempting to base treatments on moral grounds the same arguments hold. Just as we wouldn't kill one poison to save another because the moral weight of the actions do not match. Denying an effective treatment on the basis of moral grounds is pure hypocrisy when the treatment works. Especially if the reasoning is that the treatment used alternative drugs, since then we have one evil against the sand evil tempered by a good.\n\nIf we care not for helping the addict, then we need not talk about treatment at all.

                "comment": "This is a tough topic for me, growing up in a family of addicts I can totally understand both sides of societies opinions on addicts. In one way I totally empathize. I was personally addicted to benzos and I remember it started innocuously. I just needed help with my anxiety and soon I became so physically addicted that I risked dying if I quit. I don't think punishing me for buying them illegally would've helped. However in terms of the people who very often steal for drugs, sell their food stamps for drugs or choose drugs over feeding their children etc it's' easy to understand why some people have a disdain for addicts and don't want to help them at all.\n\nI definitely agree it needs to be treated as a medical or mental condition/issue but I won't lie being stolen from so many times does chip away at me and some days I feel more bitter and vengeful about drug addicts than usual. Over all though this concept is fair. I had to write an essay for a diversion class when I was in my teens and I remember telling them that the arrest had only made me drink more and it made me anxious about my future with jobs etc. \n\nA huge issue to me beyond drugs is just punishment of all crime. Branding a thief or hooker etc with a life long record will only force them back into that life style because they won't be able to acquire a great job, not easily at least. But again society of course can tend to detest these people and not want them to have the same opportunities as those who have a clean record.",

I'm surprised they didn't work in an Anti-Trump message though they sure did stab at Christians a few times though typically many churches run addiction help groups and such).\n\nThe truth about addiction is that the addiction is irrelevant or immaterial. The addict is going to do what they are going to do and you, nor your hope, care, philosophizing, understanding, money, faith, tears, pain or \"tough-love\" is going to change that addict. Ever.\n\nAs someone who comes from a family, some of whom were addicts of varying degrees, who has lost sleep, spent thousands, opened my home only to have things stolen, and seen death up close and personal, I have learned one truth: **when the addict is ready to quit, they will quit.**  Period.\n\nI've noted that when an addict, especially a heroin addict, seeks treatment, it is only because they either have lost connections, have no money or no way to get heroin. When their situation changes, they go right back. \n\nThe only time I have ever seen an addict change outside of their willingness is when you remove them from their ability to get their stuff. I had a family member who was a bad addict (jail, theft from family, etc). At some point his situation had him in out in the sticks with no way to do anything, get anything, provide for himself or routinely beg for a handout. He got a little help from a local Church, got a job and until last Christmas, when he came in to visit, was clean. What happened? He came in and suddenly had access to drugs again so he went on a bender and lost his job. \n\nHe didn't want to quit. He had to quit because there was no access. \n\n",

I prefer 'seeky' because it means that you have an inclination to seek morphine.\"\n\n\"What the fuck are you talking about?\" Shaftoe says.\n\n\"Well, suppose you have a roof with a hole in it. That means it is a leaky roof. It's leaky all the time -- even if it's not raining at the moment. But it's only leaking when it happens to be raining. In the same way, morphine-seeky means that you always have this tendency to look for morphine, even if you are not looking for it at the moment. But I prefer both of them to 'addict,' because they are adjectives modifying Bobby Shaftoe instead of a noun that obliterates Bobby Shaftoe.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------",

It seems to mirror what I think are the shortcomings of the \"medical model\" approach to addiction.\n\nThe truth is that every cigarette I smoked, every sip of every alcoholic drink I took, every hit of every bow/bong/joint I took --those were all voluntary choices. Every sip of caffeinated coffee/tea I take now is also one of these choices: knowingly ingesting a substance that results in physical and/or psychological addiction. I tried some other recreational substances along the way too. I was lucky that none of them stuck with me the way tobacco/alcohol/weed did.\n\nI knew it at the time, almost every time. (At least at first -- with mind altering substances though, soon enough I'd forget about the decisions I was making and they just became what I was doing. I was at a party, thus I was drinking and smoking weed.)\n\nSure I didn't weight the pros and cons of every intake, and maybe that is the actual point -- mindlessly consuming these substances is how one gets to addiction. But addicts are not helpless any more than a dude with a 3 bag-of-Doritos daily habit is helpless to put the Doritos down, regardless of what the 1st of the 12 steps preach. It is true certain substances you do get to the point where the physical addiction means pain unless you keep it up, but even then you still know it's a bad habit, withdrawal pain notwithstanding.\n\nWhile the author castigates those who come down with negative moral judgment on addicts, I don't think the correct reproach is trying to frame us all as if we are as helpless and blameless as someone who caught a cold at work. \n\nI think that rather avoiding judgment entirely, and instead just looking to and for practical methods, techniques/treatments/approaches that actually work to improve a person's health and well being, with demonstrated results, is where our attention is better directed.

Therefore, we shouldn't offer help to them because it incentives laziness. \"\n\nYet again with the issue of obesity, it is the same: \"If they just didn't eat as much, they wouldn't be so fat. They should take some responsibility and eat healthier. They could choose to go to the gym if they weren't so lazy!\"\n\nBut if you take a minute to think of these scenarios in the same context as addiction, you realize that the thing they have in common is they assume other people have free will/agency. This claim is often implicit, but it has dramatic consequences. So many policies that are based off the assumption of free will simply do not work. However, since this assumption is rarely even recognized (let alone questioned by those making policies), there is a perpetual disagreement about why those policies are failing. \n\nYou may argue that there is free will, and that's fine. But don't assume that it is true without an argument, and furthermore think about who is paying the consequences if you're wrong: The poor person told that he should've worked harder, the addict told to resist his urges, the fat person told to take some responsibility for his health, and many, many more",

The last two years of his life my husbands family basically didn\u2019t know what to do with him or wanted to try and help him because he continued to go back to his addiction. He had multiple attempts of suicide due to depression from all of this and his health was destroyed from all his using and he was constantly in and out of the hospital.

                "comment": "Another very important criteria that often gets overlooked is that Addiction is almost never a merely a very specific chemical/psychological phenomenon that can be isolated from a holistic perspective of the person's life. \n\nAddiction \"embeds\" itself into the \"world\" of the addict (\"World\" in the \"heideggerian\" sense if you will, the totality of the context you're inserted within), and the addiction is bound to the context.\n\nThis line of thinking has interesting implications for addiction. One is a negative one: it's very hard for someone who can't radically shift his context (or \"world\") to kick addictions, but there's a possitive implication too: a radical change of your world will most certainly help if not outright heal addiction.\n\nOne interesting case that evidences this is the case of veterans bringing back addictions from overseas, this was observed back in Vietnam. If we had measured only by chemical dosage, these people would've been classified as \"hardcore addicts\" and we would have predicted that they would have an enormously hard time kicking it. However, in the vast majority of cases, they didn't even have to try, and the supposedly \"terrible\" withdrawal symptoms were experienced as mild discomfort, like someone would describe an indigestion.\n\nWhy? Because they changed their \"mode-of-being\": the addiction was something that belonged to the soldier, all the way around the world. It's almost as if the moment they got back to society they \"switched psychological templates\" and they went back to \"husband, father, friend\", and the addiction just wasn't part of that \"template\" or \"mode-of-being\", it was something the soldier did. At the same time, we see that the people that had a hard time kicking addictions when they came back also showed the biggest challenges in \"switching\" that \"mode-of-being\" from \"Soldier\" to \"Citizen\". I think this is a really interesting little re-definition of what addiciton is (our intuition tells us that you shouldn't be able to just kick it cause you took a plane and you don't wear camo anymore).\n\nI think we're only starting to be able to conceptualize this stuff in a way that makes sense for us, but it does bring up a lot of interesting questions: to what extent can a stock broker that works 14 hours a day and lives at top speed is able to (or should desire to) kick a cocaine habit? Is it *actually cocaine* that he's addicted to, or a self-destructive mode-of-being of which cocaine is just the best \"chemo-aesthetical fit\" for that mode-of-being? Can he even *think* about conserving that same lifestyle and not do cocaine? What would even be the point?\n\nAn opioid addict who is unemployed and on food-stamps, has nothing going for him in his life, children failing out of school, is profoundly depressed. Say that we address the opioid issue in his life... in the grand scheme of things, have we *cured* that person of anything, or have we just removed a factor that will be replaced with something else that serves that function moments later?\n\nFrequently, addiction treatment is related to taking control and modifying your life, but we say this only in the context of resolving the issue of addiction. Of course, sometimes addressing the issue of addiction serves as a springboard for these people to take control of their lives *as a whole*, but what I mean is that I'm not sure that the person right next to that one who is just as depressed as the addict but doesn't have an opioid habit is all that better off, and we should be thinking about *them* too just as we think about the addict. **It's not only that addiction is a health issue, it's that depression, nihilism, cynicism and apathy are health issues, and those are not different problems. Videogames, porn, weed, carbohydrates, sugar, fucking with a lot of strangers, playing for money, opioids, coke, near-death-experiences, we are just picking our poison. And it's only when we've picked the poison that we should be concerned?**",

So, therefore, if you have ever, ever eaten too much or spent more money than you wanted to (just examples) you have also experienced a loss of the \"wanting\" battle. They are, albeit, a tiny fraction of the cravings a drug user experiences.

                "comment": "> The messy truth about addiction is that it lies somewhere in between choice and compulsion.\n\nI agree with this. I think that splitting addiction between choice and mere physical addiction is too simply. There is a third aspect. I think all living things are individual survivalists. Since we are born our DNA makes our survival a priority before anything else. It is probably how the brain is even designed, for the sole purpose of it's own survival. Animals don't have any sense to procreate to further their species, it's just it can pass on it's genes. The only reason why humans and more social animals do is because we evolved to a point where we can completely control our environment and comfort, making society almost the only thing we need to adapt to survive and why I think intelligence is going to be the next mating trait that surpasses physical attraction. But even then individual survival is the first thing in all of us. A very close second is the survival of our offspring and probably the only survivalist need that can rival our own. \nDrugs produce a physical addiction first, before you're even conscious of it. It creates new neural pathways in the first use, and the drugs from them effect your entire brain and body. You're not conscious of those pathways until the drug starts affecting other already existing brain functions. Meaning normal functions that operated on dopamine and natural happy drugs now have strong pathways that rely on this very unnatural drug. An addicts behavior is a prime example of the brain individualistic survival makeup. Because empathy goes out the window. Consequences go out the window. Maybe if the person is a parent they might think to do something for their child sometimes but only if they think they need to do it to keep their child alive, just alive.  ",

This arguement essentially removes the idea of having a satisfactory discussion about it. There should be a different word for it altogether.\n  \nTwo: all drugs should be legalized. Usually someone will say \"Oh so some junkie can just do whatever they want and steal my things?\" To which, I say, drugs should be legal, not crimes. A person should be arrested for burglary, sure. A person who does something that harms no one else, should be free to do so. What they usually overlook is that drug laws have had very little effect on the distribution and use of drugs; only the incarceration of said users, which doesn't seem very effective or just. \n\nI don't know what the solution is, but these two things seem to be things that are, in my opinion, a good start because what we have in place now doesn't seem to be working in any way that seems apparent.",

By this view, any sort of compelling enough force that could persuade us to do something would abstain us from moral agency. Addiction is a compelling force to make decisions, although so is your environment, so is your entire life, specific situations you encounter, the amalgamation of all your previous choices. In this view, nearly anything could be \u201cnot a moral failure\u201d if we could simply reach a hurdle of \u201ctoo compelling for a person to resist,\u201d which is a hurdle the author doesn\u2019t define.\n\nAlso, this article presupposes that those who start using hard drugs in the first place did so in some sort of vacuum, as if they were unaware of the consequences of doing so. Growing up in the era of anti-drug campaigns, and having lost many friends to drug overdoses, I knew that they were well aware of their actions before they made a conscious choice to engage in taking drugs. I know that because my friends who died sat next to me in the same presentations I did and talked to the same addicts I did, and we even talked about the consequences of their drug use in the early stages.\n\nFinally, why does addiction need not be a moral failure in order for us to implement harm reduction policy? And why is societal shame a bad thing? Social shame, and I\u2019d argue especially in bourgeoise morality, is the silent hand that guides tons of people little by little away from poor moral and social choices like this every day anyway. Personally, a lot of my addict friends weren\u2019t in environments that sufficiently shamed them for doing drugs. They lived in areas with a crumbling sense of community and identity, few job prospects, lots of recreational use of pills. This escapism, especially with the male friends I lost, mirrored my other male friends retreat from society in other ways as well through video games, nerd culture, drinking, raw pursuit of money and all sorts of really pointless fancies that they deluded themselves in rather than forming any meaningful relationships or participating or feeling part of society at large.\n\n That\u2019s a separate convo though, and basically, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a conflict to me to viewing someone as morally failing, making poor choices, and offering them a chance at redemption especially through harm reduction policies we know will keep them alive (like SIS, drugs for supplementation). Moral shame just seems like an added preventative and macro societal benefit. I could see how this might make it harder for addicts to come forward for help (who wants to admit they\u2019re morally failing?) but the posture should be one that redemption is possible. And honestly it\u2019s just more truthful for someone to admit they made a series of moral failures that lead them into addiction and taking charge to become better despite their faults.",

I've been using opiates for about 6 years and I'm 25 now. I started using because ad's didn't work for me and I've been suicidal since my early childhood bc of an abusive family member. My first almost successful suicide attempt was at 6 Yo. \n\n\n\nI have to keep people at arms length so that I don't disappoint anyone. It's horrible to watch myself do things that harm my health and future prospects. Especially my recent problems with speedballs (heroin and coke mixed and injected) threatens to fuck up my life as my sleep cycle, concentration and ability to interact socially are impacted. I don't want to continue spending my money on this shit, I'd rather save up for buying an apartment. But I can't (or can only rarely) control my behavior rationally. It's crazy and hard to explain, which is why I don't know how to ask for help or even what kind of help to get. I don't want my 'friends' (I would never ask anything of them) to see me as a burden. \n\n\n\n\n\nOn another note. If I didn't live in Germany and didn't have free, insurance paid access to maintenance drugs, I wouldn't be able to pull my own weight. I wouldn't be earning my bachelors degree by the end of this semester and I wouldn't have the option to quit the needle when I have the strength to do so or run out of money. I hope that American addicts will soon have similar access do maintenance, safe injection sites and needle exchanges. Harm reduction is the reason that hard drugs haven't been a problem in Germany since the 80s. The notion that the addict needs to hit Rock bottom only hard enough is dangerous. I get that it's not easy to have an addict in your life. But parents who put their children on the streets when they need support and love, friends and SO's who set ultimatums when the addict is swallowed by self hatred are not leading the way to recovery. The notion that one needs to be clean to dare try anything is another dangerous one. If I would have followed the advice given by NA and therapists, I'd still be caught in the cycle of withdrawing and relapsing. Instead I acknowledged I couldn't do it atm and resumed the things I could do. Imho I need to build a life worth fighting for in order to fight hard enough for it. In that fight, you need allies. Be that ally, instead of putting your loved one further down. ",

In most cases like this, we know the risks of the dangerous activity and do it anyway. Anyone who suffers with these illnesses deserves treatment and compassion. \n\nBut I don\u2019t see how the Socratic view here is wrong.  There\u2019s only one self. The example about the dad having two selves fighting seems like a cop out. The addict dad who chooses to get high instead of picking up his kids is the same person who chose to use drugs repeatedly until he became addicted. There is moral failure in that. And that is ok. We all make bad decisions, even against our own morals, from time to time, and sometimes the consequences are more grave than we expected. \n\n",

But the simple concept and basics of philosophy is what really helped me start understanding myself better, in my most lost times. If it was taught in public school I can honestly say it would have helped me tremendously. It was the one thing I've thought about since a kid but never knew about until my more educated private schooled brother knew to point me toward when I kept talking to him about things like my mind, old wisdom, and oddly enough occult, and metaphysical stuff. I actually started reading occult stuff by old freemason philosophers like manly hall, before I knew what philosophy was. My parents highest education is high school so thats a reason. Also here in Hawaii we're last in education as we've had to build up from scratch in a relatively short amount of time. The ancient Hawaiians were actually very philosophical now that I've learned more about it. Free the chains of the brain. ",

I think it\u2019s important to rehabilitate people, since not everyone has had the same upbringing or youth circumstances. We need to be able to teach people that other folks aren\u2019t objects to be manipulated; they are individuals to be loved.\n\nI also think it\u2019s important that jail/prison is a place that people don\u2019t WANT to keep coming back to, while not driving people to fight the rehabilitation system. People do still go to jail as a punishment, and I feel like that should probably be a part of the environment, right?\n\nHow do we do that? How do we do both things?\n\nI guess I might as well ask how we change the whole culture of \u201ccool to be ignorant and cool to be bad\u201d both in and out of jail/prison. ",

However, if masses of people are unemployed, we can almost be certain that the problem is a socio-economic one. Likewise, if one person is depressed, then that is probably an individual problem. However, if masses of people are depressed, then we can almost certainly point to a social problem. \n\nI wholeheartedly agree. When you have a production line manufacturing millions of products, maybe one or two defects is a fluke. When you have dozens of similar defects, something is wrong on the manufacturing line.\n\nUnfortunately, i believe the issue is being pressured by economic and technological changes.\n\nOn the economic side, at least in the US, the middle and lower classes have been slowly squeezed for several decades, these pressures are manifesting as rants about things like gas prices, a dollar or two more a gallon is really not a big deal by itself, it\u2019s just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back when housing, education, and healthcare are imposing unavoidable burdens.\n\nOn the technological side, cell phones and search engines are powerful tools to enable us to dwell on our own inner thoughts and have the effect of drowning out the actual world around us. Social media takes it further and rewards those who are \u201cin\u201d (those who show off the appearance of success, even when it\u2019s fabricated), as well as mocking or criticizing those who are \u201cout\u201d. The result is that we impose unrealistic expectations on ourselves.\n\nWhen we do have opportunities for forming new connections, they impose costs such as time off work, $ entry fee, emotional costs of confronting uncertainty, etc., such that if someone is under prolonged stress, they may find themselves unable or unwilling to form new social connections. Our ability to absorb ourselves in our cell phones, even for healthy individuals, may decrease our propensity to seek out and connect with otherwise alienated, marginalized, or lonely individuals.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure how to solve this. We need to find a spot for every person in society.",

I appreciate that the author is trying to make Hegel relevant by tying his ideas to a particular current issue, but in my opinion it's a poor and misleading attempt and anyone reading it uncritically will be worse off, not better, in their understanding of mental health.\n\nIt gives a decent, though completely uncritical, summary of Hegel's ideas about mental illness. But it then simply assumes this is all relevant to the modern condition without making any argument for that whatsoever. The implied conclusion, that the problems we have today are due to a \"sick society\", might be attractive to us all, but it is not supported in any way by this article.\n\nThere is this conclusion, for example:\n\n>Likewise, if one person is depressed, then that is probably an individual problem. However, if masses of people are depressed, then we can almost certainly point to a social problem.\u00a0\n\nHuh? This seems almost like the author has tried to force their idea into the format of the apocryphal Stalin quote \u201cIf only one man dies of hunger, that is a tragedy. If millions die, that\u2019s only statistics.\u201d But it just doesn't make sense, because the author is now talking about causality, rather than merely how we might describe the phenomenon of mental illness. Clearly, at no point in history, has a single person been depressed, it has always been some \"mass\". So we can infer nothing of the causality of depression from this.\n\nThe argument, I suppose, is that something about our modern society is causing mental illness at a *higher rate* than it should or could be. Though the argument is only really implied, and is effectively absent from the article in any concrete form. I can imagine that the author might have made an argument for this using Hegel's definitions, but they don't. In fact, after spending a long time discussing Hegel, they use an entirely different definition of mental illness to imply the point this modern society is \"sick\":\n\n>According to the World Health Organization, there has been a 13% rise in mental health conditions and substance use in the last decade alone.\n\nWHO apparently defines mental health loosely as \"a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community\". Which doesn't sound much like Hegel's definition at all. And that's entirely aside from the actual statistics WHO use, which I assume are the vastly more \"medicalised\" materialist definitions outlined in the DSM-V and used with variable accuracy and interpretations by clinicians (and reported with variable veracity by individual local and national medical authorities) before being distilled by the WHO into an alarming, but not actually very illuminating, single statistic. And lumping in \"substance use\" (not even substance doesn't *abuse*) doesn't help us understand what's going on with these statistics at all. \n\nThe authors conclusions are simply not connected to the body of the article. What definition of mental health do they propose, Hegel's (loose) definition, the WHOs, something in between? And if the definition is so vague, where is the evidence that, by any particular definition, mental illness is rising or is higher than you would expect in a \"healthy\" society? Where is the evidence that this is because of broad social issues, as opposed to any one of numerous confounding factors, such as more awareness, acceptance, and reporting, or a misalignment between reporting and the actual definition used? And if that's the argument, what does any of this have to do with Hegel's definition?",

                "comment": "We also have to differentiate between \"being depressed\" and \"*feeling* depressed\", or clinical vs situational depression. Most people who struggle with depressive periods do so due to situational depression, where one or more factors / situations in their lives make them *feel* depressed. Usually if these conditions are fixed, which could be better living conditions, finding friends / a partner (if the person is lonely), getting over grief, the depressive episode fades away.\n\nClinical depression can't be fixed so easily as it's a condition that we don't know all that much about. Situational depression can provoke clinical depression in people who are prone to it but it can also happen when \"everything is fine\" in someone's life. So clinical depression, as a medical condition, isn't going away just by fixing living conditions and work hours.",

Marx's dialectics are still very relevant and can give us much insight into how this system affects humans. \n\nWithin later Marxist theory, like Mark Fisher's work *Capitalist Realism*, there is also some criticism of Western mental healthcare, for obvious reasons. **It is, at its core, conditioning you to somewhat ignore the systems at work around you - systems you alone have almost no power to affect (unless everyone else took off their rose tinted glass, sat with their feelings and then organized for change.)**\n\nBut this is hard to do because not only are the systems self-preserving - and therefore hard to fight -  but also, people still need to make a living and many don't have time to dwell, or organize, so they get analysed or seek chemical treatment (which is sometimes, obviously quite necessary for some) to 'fix' the problems preventing them from being 'productive'. \n\nWestern therapy, in many cases, encourages you to be positive and not dwell on how your first world lifestyle may be causing you and many others around the world, harm. (Due to the [neo-liberalism](https://theconversation.com/how-neoliberalism-is-damaging-your-mental-health-90565)\nthat brought capitalism to every corner of the planet just so, for example, we can have 11 year olds making our clothing.)\n\n***But we should be thinking about these things.***\nAnd even though individuals alone are hardly to [blame](https://i.imgur.com/Xgv4O75.jpg), some of us still, I feel, carry that guilt with us, whether consciously or subconsciously, and no amount of therapy will change the fact that it is *wrong* - and we *still* feel powerless, while corporations shift the blame to our lifestyles, but at the same time they are telling us to 'drive less', they are also encouraging us to [have more kids](https://i.imgur.com/vxzWUAc.jpg) to buy their shit. \n\nAnd then when it comes to not winning an unwinnable rat race: \n\n&amp;gt;Depression in this context may appear almost self-protective: an opt-out from an unwinnable set of continual competitions.\u00a0\n\n&amp;gt;But this falsehood of \u201cfree choice\u201d demotivates and depoliticises. In such a world, depression, anxiety, narcissism (the primitive defence of the infantile self against overwhelming attack) are entirely logical responses. It has been\u00a0confirmed\u00a0that neoliberal societies make their citizens physically as well as mentally sick; the effect is magnified the more unequal the society and the more unprotected its citizens from free-market \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d.\n\nBottom line: We feel guilty because we are guilty, but we are stuck in a system where any hope of opting out successfully is basically nil. I also, of course, believe we should help ourselves, if possible, before we can help our communities and the rest of the world - but **the Western models of behavioral and emotional therapy (including DBT, or Dialectic Based Therapy) are basically asking us to deny reality and remain integrated and invested in a society *we should absolutely* find cruel and unjust.**\n\nDepressive realism somewhat allows some of us to be a little more realistic about what we are doing and the ripple effect our lives have. And I don't feel many models of therapy address this - but I would love to be wrong. \n\n**There is a ton of shit to be fucking sad about. \nSome people don't 'get better' and are sick of this shit show. So they choose to die. Nothing 'crazy' about that.**\n\nFrom this [article](https://www.madinamerica.com/2017/08/mad-world/) :\n\n&amp;gt;\u201cMany people believe, and are encouraged to believe, that these problems and disorders \u2013 psychosis, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, self-harm \u2013 these symptoms of a \u2018sick world\u2019 (to use James Hillman\u2019s terrific description) are theirs, rather than the world\u2019s. \n\n&amp;gt;\u2018But what if your emotional problems weren\u2019t merely your own?\u2019, asks Tom Syverson. \u2018What if they were\u00a0our\u00a0problems? What if the real problem is that we\u2019re living in a wrong society? Perhaps Adorno was correct when he said, \u201cwrong life cannot be lived rightly\u201d.\u2019**\n\n&amp;gt;The root of this \u2018living wrongly\u2019 seems to be because **we live in a social and economic system at odds with both our psychology and our neurology, with who we are as social beings.**\n\n...On this same [study](https://www.redpepper.org.uk/a-mad-world-capitalism-and-the-rise-of-mental-illness/) :\n\n&amp;gt;The shocking extent of this mental health 'epidemic\u2019 is made all the more disturbing by the knowledge that so much of it is preventable.*\n\n[Too long](https://i.imgur.com/zhi2i10.png);[Didn't read](https://i.imgur.com/KCXUjbL.png)",

I agree with what the essay you shared says - that we need to see depression in its relation with society. I think it would be interesting to see a follow up article engaging with more recent thinkers on what trends in society accelerate this depression of the masses. Is it something in our modern lifestyle, as some traditionalist thinkers might suggest or perhaps something in capitalism as the source I sent seems to indicate? Who knows?",

I have really appreciated the factd you  cited Hegel, just because he teaches us, and before Marx, that every individual condiction and every internal structure is a social one and i would add a political one. We have the duty to end this, just because the toxicity of the system has become unbearable for everyone, let\u2019s just think to these phenomena and everything will come clear. \n\nIf we investigate deeper we can discover that even Freud, in his book about the civilization, says that modern society is in its structure ill. But why this? Why even if we live in a state of wellness society is still ill and show this illness in his chosen childs? I can\u2019t answer these questions but I think it is not connected solely to capitalism, just because crazy minds have ever existed. It has something to do with the differences every society put in game, which set apart someone Who maybe has seen something true about it, society- a good starting point to evaluate this is certainly la Historie de la Folie by Foucault.",

By joining the group that was once considered mad, the protagonists gain new wisdom. Only when they revert back, do we see who is truly mad--those who turn away from unity and happiness to grasp firmly to a fear and anxiety based society that is no less real.\n\nWhat if, instead of exiling those who we consider as mad, we revered these individuals?

Most people are ignorant, not stupid, it's important to remember the difference. \n\nIf someone disagrees with you it's either because they have different values or different information and it is important to figure out which one. If you have different values then there is nothing that can be done, it is very difficult to change someone's base values. \n\nIf you find that the person has different information then you must deduce which set of information is more in line with the truth and must debunk bad information and cement good information.\n\nIt's not very often that someone's opinion will change during a debate because the ego is very powerful. But with this method you can at least chip away at ignorance. ",

There are times when I know I'm reading (or hearing) something that I know is well-articulated and coherent and it kind of makes me want to stop reading.\n\nAnd I don't want to stop because the other person is so wrong that it is upsetting, but because I fear part of me might actually be converted.  *I might be convinced myself*.  And, at that moment, it is so tempting to just find some pedantic quibble or make some snarky remark to avoid engaging with it.\n\nAt that point, if you truly believe in what you're arguing, that's the moment you have to find the will to really make an effort to understand the other point of view and counter it at its best.  It's like a tree needing wind to grow stronger; your argument needs stiff resistance to be its best.",

                "comment": "This is a way too long story about the greatest teacher I've ever known:\n\nI taught middle school science at a poorly performing inner city school for a while. The city would grade your school based on the pass rate on the state wide exam at the end of the year. Before I started the science pass rate was about 50%, and it was about 30-35% in English and math. I was able to raise that score in science to 82%, which was great. \n\nHowever, our social studies pass rate was 98%. We were a small school with about 40 students per grade (middle school was 6, 7, 8). I think there were only 3 that did not pass my first year. I couldn't believe those stats, so I sat in on some of the social study classes. Their teacher would cover a historical event in the curriculum, and then have each student write a short essay arguing for or against a statement he would provide. For example he would have a statement like \"the Roman army was the greatest in history\". He would leave it intentionally vague and ask students to form an opinion and write a page or so defending their position. Then he would read their arguments and assign them to two teams. One in support of the statement, and one against. \n\nThey would have a few days to research and refine their arguments, and then they would hold a Socratic seminar. Each student would have to individually argue a certain point against someone on the other team (e.g. the Mongolian army conquered more land, so they should be considered greater). \n\nIt was amazing to see it in action. These were kids that were 12-15 years old, and some of them were reading on a second grade level. But during the debate, they spoke with conviction and were held entirely accountable for their position. You couldn't slack off and not do your research. If you did, you'd recieve a zero for the entire week or so and would have to stay late everyday until you actually did the work. Plus, nobody wanted to stand up in front of the class and look dumb. These kids loved to argue, and he used that to their advantage. \n\nMy favorite part, and the reason this post made me thing of this story, is that if someone brought up a really interesting point, or two students really seemed convicted about their argument, he would have them switch positions. Right in the middle of their debate they would have to take on the opponent's side. Because of this, each person had to research both sides to every argument. ",

If I am seriously respectful, this respect presumes respectfully recognizing precisely the strongest version on the truth of the other, even if it is not articulated as such in free interlocution. At the same time, the discursive articulation of other's case would presume or instantiate a respect that exceeds any particular argument, which is nonviolence and good will. Holding in that condition, in the face of the oppression of the other, throws then into the respect they already have in a crippled form and brings it to a crisis. They may, of course, proceed with violence, but they cannot extricate themselves from the condition of respect so easily. \n\nSo imagine someone gets arrested protesting Republicare, but does a in a \"WFS\", that is, a well formed satyagraha. This is one in which the respect is maintained to the highest degree. It is this particular respect that, as respect, presumes the other's strongest argument. But this all occurs in the context in which that about which there is disagreement pertains to the policies that affect both parties and may be enforced directly, and where there may not be free speech or room for dialogue. Yet we may imagine that in the overall political conditions the respectful \"strongest argument\" had been articulated in one setting or another, such as letters to the editor or as press conference. \n\nRespectful maintenance or holding to truth, however, does not amount to the oppression other coming around/agreeing. But agreeing doesn't amount to overall respect, either. \n\nIdeally both would be there, but things are rarely ideal. The question is, why exactly does utmost respect *presume* articulation and temporary affirmation of the other's strongest argument? And to the point even that one does not have to fully express it? If one is showing utmost respect, it is never realized in all things anyhow, since all things don't happen. Yet as each thing presents itself, as respect is renewed again and again, it becomes clear that as regards the cause in dispute (and grounds for oppression), one would, *of course* -- in the due course of respect -- observe the other's strongest argument, not some cheap trick, which, in the case of the latter, is a kind of violence.\n\nBut this all means that the crisis in question is always in part a matter of nonviolence as such, regardless of the cause of matter at hand.
