Just before that, I started smelling hot plastic - my graphics card was running +90°C because again, Vanguard disabled my cooling software (My PC case got very bad airflow, I have to decrease my GPU performance to keep it cool enough).\n\nVanguard really needs to prevent us from launching the game while X software is active -and asking us to close it, even if we need to reboot just after- instead of disabling everything silently.\n\nEDIT regarding my GPU: the issue with my graphics card started few days ago but I wasn't able to link it to Vanguard. Since my case was made to hold a GT630, the airflow sucks hard and I made a profile which I always use with target performance at 75% for my GTX970. Less performance, but less heat and then less noise. Few days ago, Asus GPU Tweak gave me \"Error BIOS load failed\" when starting, and my GPU was spinning like crazy in a TFT game. I didn't fry my GPU (but others are claiming so), but it's not comfortable at all for me to have it blowing at fullspeed when playing a TFT game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/RiotArkem got downvoted into hell, so i'll copy/pasta what he said just in case\n\n\" We're working on ways to make the experience better. Our current notification pop-ups aren't as good as they could be and we're looking for ways to give you more control over how Vanguard works.\n\nWe're happy to do anything we can to make this smoother for everyone as long as it doesn't give an opening for cheaters.\n\nTL;DR: Expect improvements before launch.\"\n\n\\----\n\nedit: thx for the silvers!\n\nedit2: thanks for the 4 golds, kind strangers!\n\nedit3: thanks a lot for the plat!",

When I heard Shroud complain in one of his videos, I felt the need to give the icons my own hot take.\n\n**Why I felt like the Valorant ranked icons were lacking:**\n\n* Silhouettes are not distinct enough\n* Platinum is a rusted copper color\n* Immortal and Valorant don’t feel powerful enough\n* Tiers are cleverly incorporated into the icons, but it makes every rank feel the same, and not intuitive\n\n**What I tried to achieve in my design:**\n\n* Progression of silhouettes. Each rank grows upon the last\n* Intuitive colors that rank up with you\n* “Make Immortal and Valorant great again”\n* Easy to tell which tier\n* Taking advantage of the existing Valorant imagery, such as:\n   * Valorant logo\n   * Valorant ranked icon\n   * Ultimate charge dots\n   * Valorant loading screen spark animation\n\nHere is my design:\n\n[Colored](https://preview.redd.it/74o9bevakyw41.png?width=8288&format=png&auto=webp&s=934c467ad9e38045fe2959b26aa5557e31b00e0a)\n\n[Grayscale](https://preview.redd.it/2leqpecckyw41.png?width=8288&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbe058fe987a173218ac9f456ab6d16e33e93da5)\n\nI reused as many of the original colors as possible. I eventually had to do some tweaking because bronze, gold, immortal used very similar colors. I used Phoenix as inspiration for Immortal, which seems apt, right?\n\nHere’s a mockup of what it would look like in-game (screenshot taken from somewhere on Reddit):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1eye1niekyw41.png?width=8192&format=png&auto=webp&s=61166bce70e4d2a1b97dc666fe7c869edee26a11\n\n**My design process:**\n\n* Sketching a fuck ton of ideas and researching ranked icons from other video games\n* Looking at a lot of Valorant imagery to create a moodboard\n* Mocking up icons in Figma (because I’m a UI/UX designer) in grayscale first to create distinct silhouettes\n* Adding colors\n* Mocking it up on a screenshot to see what it would look like\n\nOverall, took me a day to do. Shout-out to my boyfriend who gave really helpful critiques throughout the process. Hope you all like it!\n\n[My last sketch before taking it to Figma.](https://preview.redd.it/vx7j9hdoktw41.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ab1c5108e7908bdc81a3b858fb5d3dfaf9d8fd4)\n\n[What all tiers would look like.](https://preview.redd.it/qgbs8can8uw41.png?width=8288&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6cfdbfdda4f0c9c42be406f10b6e36ec7d07427)\n\nEdit: I woke up to 12.7k upvotes. Thank you all very much for the enthusiasm and feedback. Solid points and ideas made in the comments.   \n\n\nEdit edit: 14.4k upvotes-- you guys make me want to go back and try a few things, such as adding embers to Immortal, and tweaking the colors to align more with the matte aesthetic of the UI. I meant for Platinum to feel a different, like a breaking point into high rank. It was a risk, but I personally think the shape is really cool. If this ever were implemented for real, the tier dots might have to be changed for small res.",

I noticed there's a diamond space in the middle for all the ranks, so I wonder about maybe using that?  So at rank 3, you'd have 3 vertically stacked chevrons in the middle (like the singular chevron in your Gold rank), at rank 2, only 2 chevrons, at rank 1 only 1 chevron.  You'd have to redo some of the later ranks apart from valorant, but it could be interesting.  \n\nI also think you have the right idea with the materials, but I think Diamond and Immortal could be a bit more glowy or luminous, especially comparing them to higher ranks in OW like Diamond and Masters.  And of course Valorant would be glowy and have the lightning bolt particle effect.",

Kicking myself for not getting one earlier\n* I haven't studied agent-specific abilities for each map enough. I couldn't tell you where the hell to shoot Sova's recon bolt. I just blast that shit and hope for the best.\n* Up until recently, I had a comically high mouse sensitivity\n* I tend to play at night to chill out, and alcohol is usually involved in that...\n\nIn summary: I'm 32 and this is my first video game where I have to do homework and training to get better at.

            "description": "Hey guys, I'm a 10 year CS player here. Previously played at Level 9 Faceit and A - ESEA. Have probably 1000+ hours of watching pro games under my belt, and even more spent in KZ and HnS servers. I love Valorant, and I love a lot of what they're trying to do with this game in comparison to CS. But, I think the current OP meta is a result of almost every short coming the game has right now (for the most part).\n\nFirstly, I think it's important to preface this by saying that Valorant is 100% by design, made to be easier / more approachable than CS:GO. You can see this in almost every aspect of the game. If it's something that was intimidating to new players in CS, it's been massively simplified here. Spray patterns are far less aggressive. Lineups have been almost entirely eliminated, or completely streamlined. Movement speed has been reduced to allow for easier tracking and aiming. Counter-strafing has been forgotten and replaced by instant momentum. Even the slight advantage you got from good movement (brought along by thousands of hours of practice in CS:GO) has been entirely eliminated by a massive simplification of movement in general, as well as how severe tagging is. I'm not saying these are negative aspects of the game. I understand almost if not all of these changes. Tons of these choices succeed in their desired goal, and it's lead to tons of my friends enjoying this game despite never getting more than 4 games into CS.\n\nWith all that said tho, lots of these choices indirectly feed into the current OP meta.\n\nI don't say this lightly either. If you were to directly compare the AWP and the OP, the AWP is hands down 3x more powerful than the OP currently is.\n\nIt boasts :\n\n* More ammo overall, and more ammo per clip.\n* Instantaneous ADS, and instantaneous Accuracy after scoping in. (though this is more a trait of all scoped weapons in CS:GO)\n* Better hip-fire accuracy.\n* Higher ROF\n* More forgiving movement accuracy\n\n//Thanks to u/IAmNotOnRedditAtWork for pointing some of these out as they escaped me\n\nI have a shortish video on this, with some old community server / lower level faceit games. It's presented as more of a frag movie than anything so there's no need to watch it, but I do think it can offer some important context when talking about how insane the AWP actually is for high level players.\n\nI've edited it to have specific time stamps in the description so that you can jump between the clips that are actually relevant to this discussion. Turn down volume as there is music and I'm sure its obnoxious. [Here you go](https://youtu.be/pOV2nbWDYro)\n\nDespite the obvious advantages the AWP has, we don't really see it being as prevalent and oppressive as we do in Valorant. We do not see double AWP and Triple AWP rounds being NEAR as viable as they are here, with triple AWP rounds being almost nonexistent.\n\nI chalk this up to quite a few things :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Movement speed. I think this is discounted quite a bit by nearly everyone. But people fail to realize how big of a deal this really is. I don't think I need to elaborate on this too much. But I think it's important to highlight \"punishing\" an AWPer. Typically, in CS you're only going to punish an AWPer if they miss their shot. Sure you can smoke them off or flash them, but typically at a high level they'll be playing in a position where it's easy to fall back and avoid being traded if they do get flashed off their angle, that is until you're on site. (Also important to note that not all AWPers play aggressive at lower levels). If it's mathematically easier to hit shots in Valorant, you bet your ass this is having an overall effect on how consistent this weapon can perform. It also (purposefully) eliminates the usefulness of jiggle peeking or baiting shots, which is a massive part of counter-play in CS. I'm not saying they should increase movement speed. I just think pointing this out is healthy for understanding and discussing this topic as a whole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Movement Speed pt. 2. On top of movement speed in Valorant being much lower, many CS players will probably tell you that the way in which you move in Valorant is instantaneous. There is no counter strafing, and as a result, if you were to stand still, and then start running, you reach your max velocity almost immediately, if not immediately. This is the same in reverse. You lose your momentum the second you let go off WASD, your momentum being what brings about innaccuracy. This allows the OP to be hyper aggressive in situations where it shouldn't be. Period. You can hold an angle, whiff your shot, and then repeek that same angle aggressively all because you have no aim penalty within a time frame where your aggression should be punishable. In CS:GO the max velocity is higher, and the acceleration has a longer time between min and max. This makes it so that repeeking an angle has a window of innaccuracy that is PARAMOUNT in balancing for a weapon like this. The OP in Valorant currently has little counter-play outside of maybe DDoSing your opponent and hoping they miss shots.'\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Utility. This isn't a secret. Most the player-base is probably aware in some form that this is having an effect on the meta. On top of there being very little vision limiting utility (smokes), I think the lack of counter play regarding flashes is also an issue. In CS, it's usually quite easy to see a flash coming, and depending on your weapon and/or position, either turn and avoid the flash, or to turn and run entirely. Sometimes if it's a pop flash you'll tank it and pray you don't die. But in Valorant, the flashes are very very quick to pop, and they last almost no time at all. You can't act off your own flash at all on most angles, and ton's of choke points require you to walk a distance where the flash is entirely negated anyway. For instance, Ascent A site. If you flash from main the distance between main and site is large enough that most people holding close aren't going to be flashed by the time you're pushed up. So maybe you get the AWPer off the long angle they're holding, and then you start pushing only for the person holding close to take contact and have the AWPer peek back out. This is why we see Phoenix being so viable in TSM's lineup. Flashing out smokes gives the entire team the biggest possible window in order to act on that utility. It's basically equivalent to a pop flash in CS, and also allows you to have more control over where you're flashing onto a site. So you can flash and pop out of the smoke much quicker than if you were around a corner, and you can also flash much deeper into a choke point then you'd normally be able to. That said, this is not a direct counter to OP meta. It's just an issue with flashes I've noticed, and a sort of \"work around\" I've seen take center stage.\n\nAnd this kinda brings me to my next issue. And probably the one we all should have expected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Map design. Outside of most the maps feeling incredibly linear, and despite them feeling like Hallway simulator 2020. I think there's another issue in relation to thoughtful map design. One of the things I mentioned above was how certain elements were streamlined, in relation to utility mainly. This, in my opinion, also relates to the map design.\n\nCS has very tried and true bits of utility at play. Smokes, Mollies, and Flashes. When you play CS at a level where executes are necessary, it's actually quite fascinating to learn how each map has been designed with utility constantly in mind. Cache B site for instance, there's a window directly above site meant for throwing utility. Mirage A has a massive area above ramp for throwing util. Inferno Apts even has fucking windows on the opposite side of site, with a chimney adjacent to them in order for you to bank utility off of. Dust 2 recently underwent a change in B tuns to allow for more utility and site executes given how hard the site was too take control of. Whether it be on attacks or retakes. Valorant has streamlined \"utility\" so much, that they've forgotten the exact reason why it was implemented in the way that it was in CS:GO, and why it worked so well. Valorant has thrown thoughtful map design out the window in favor of meaningless gimmicks that fall flat after your 5th game on the map.\n\nGuess what Riot, I don't care about opening and closing destructible doors, or ropes that give you a surprising amount of velocity and accuracy while attached, and definitely not 3 fucking sites. I play ranked games where my opponents go 3-14 and then start fragging out when they decide to whip out the OP. The gun is too easy to use and it sports almost zero counter-play. IT IS AN ISSUE. I understand not jumping the gun and rushing towards some half ass balancing decision, but you've been so quick to address smaller issues that didn't actively suck the fun out of the game and reward players for using an obvious crutch.\n\n// People have pointed out some poor phrasing on my part here, would just like to iterate that I'm not against these kinds of gimmicks, they have a place and I don't mean to undermine anyone who enjoys them. I just think these gimmicks are being used in place of good map design. Sort of a \"sure ascent is a terrible map but here are some doors you can open and close, this one has ropes!\"\n\nAscent is the closest map to CS design we currently have in Valorant in my opinion, and it still ignores most of what made those maps work in the first place. Scrap the gimmicks. Nobody wants this random shit. I want maps with intelligent design choices, meaningful spots for fair trades at the beginning of rounds, I want maps designed with rotates in mind and counter-play at heart. You can tell CS maps are designed with all the games utility in mind. I'm constantly reminded that I can't say the same about any of Valorant's maps.\n\nWith that being said, what are some ways to fix these issues?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Add a slight time frame with the OP that adds inaccuracy after moving, keep this outside of movement speed, have it be its own value. For instance, if you scope in with the OP, then strafe to the side and stop moving, add an extra .5 or whatever amount of time where there is still an innaccuracy debuff applied. OPs are meant for holding angles, they are already ridiculously good at that in this game. Punish them for playing aggressive.\n2. Phoenix's flash needs a slight \"rework\" to come more into line with vision blocking utility in relation to cutting off angles. Phoenix's flash shouldn't pop so quickly. I think it sports niche usability with little counter-play. When throwing out Phoenix's flash, have it hover in air at the very end of it's duration while giving it an obvious \"charge-up\" animation, give a larger (but still small) window in order to either back off an angle, or to turn your back too it, and then have it pop, and increase the time frame in which you're flashed slightly. I also considered having Phoenix be invulnerable to his flash, as a way to give Phoenix a way to more reliably entry, while still forcing him to play slightly outside of his team in these situations, (or risk flashing them). This promotes playing anti flash and/or less predictable and maybe even more dangerous positions in order to deny Phoenix this ground when he attempts to entry. I think it adds a reasonable amount of counter play in a game that severely lacks it currently, I think it gives Phoenix some needed independence and room to make these types of solo plays, while also letting an agent specifically gain ground around OPers. I think a good way to envision this is Ascension A site. Instead of OPing heaven when you know Phoenix likes to flash in from main and push you off your angle, you can play on site to the left, and play anti flash in order to kill him when he attempts to entry. Diagram [Here](https://ibb.co/NL9g8WW)\n3. LET YOUR COMMUNITY DESIGN MAPS FOR YOU. For the love of god the fact that I even have to say this makes me angry. Community interaction has lead to CS being the powerhouse of an E-sport it is today. Volcano's involvement is proof of this. No one is saying you have to add them as actual competitive maps, but acting like you can produce better content than your entire community is ridiculously naive when you've already shown that's NOT the case. Add some kind of community tool for your players to design maps, and have some kind of game mode that rotates these featured community maps every couple of months or something. Even if it's just to give the team at Riot ideas and inspiration. I was worried months ago when you said you weren't going to allow even the most basic of community creativity in this regard. It's okay to be wrong Riot. Valve was smart enough to realize the community could carry some of that workload, while also teaching them and giving them inspiration. Volcano is on your dev team because of this reality.",

So I can reliably peek from mid link and as soon as I can see the doorway of Tree/cat, I stop, and zoom in, and before the enemy knows it, I killed them.",

            "description": "1. It is jazz. Lineups don't exist. Instead, players improvise their utilities based on their mood and the current situation. You'll never see them use those utilities in that exact way ever again, and that's what makes them magical. Tear away the veneer of practice and learned habits, and you have raw human expression. Viper walls cast seemingly at random, Sova darts that give more information than they get. An ambitious Sage who learns to place her wall on top of boxes can be found proudly standing atop a new box every round.\n  \n2. It is human connection. Duels are just that: Duels. There's no TTK, there's no reaction time. Two players meet each other like vagrants in the night. Their friends are far away, they are strangers to each other. They unload an entire clip at each other, sometimes all at once, sometimes in bursts between peeking and hiding. They cut each other's hair, they lick each other's toes. By the time one has killed the other, he has come to view his fallen opponent less as a stranger and more as a dear companion in a brutal world. He feels grief and mourns the loss.  \n  \n3. It teaches contentment. Iron players know every feeling. We are the tiniest fish in the ocean of Valorant. We are the minnows, and it's the poor fish between us and sharks who come into our little pools and beat up on us when the sharks are through with them. But we accept it, and instead of passing on this trauma, we sublimate it down within ourselves and become stronger, though not better. We have died to the last bullet of a full Odin spray, we have been caught with our knives out, we have peeked angles that were clearly being held by a sniper, we have wasted a full clip and then been killed by a Frenzy, a Stinger, or a slurry of Guardian bodyshots, we have watched someone reload their gun in front of us and then kill us with it. We have felt it all. We did it again the next round. And it's okay. We have found peace.  \n  \n4. It is true love. The same ocean teems with covetous, desirous, rapacious fish. Little fish seek bigger fish, and plot still for even bigger fish. No such delusions in Iron. Every human connection is genuine. Girls love boys for who they are and not their skill, which is little, and vice versa, and vice vica, and verse versa. There are no clout chasers, no rank chasers, no one adds anyone else in Iron with the false hope that they'll be carried to Diamond. Connections are made to deepen the individual experience in a way that only love can. Without the pretense, two gamers together can create a jazz that one alone never could, this is the power of true love.",

Honestly, I don't know why first bullet inaccuracy with the vandal is so bad or why it's even a thing in the game in the first place.\n\nEDIT: After reading a lot of comments on this thread I've taken into consideration the fact that I could've used ADS and crouching for more accuracy, that's something I typically do if I'm in very long-range combat, like for example when pushing C long on heaven, but I don't think that at the distance I was standing at on the clip to be fair for my bullets to be so inaccurate while standing still, putting my crosshair right on the sova's head, tap-firing and missing the first three shots.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/ifsbki/video/vuhzoses8zi51/player",

            "description": "Compared to CSGO when playing deathmatch, here most of the time i just gotta use the sound of the floor to realize where the enemies are and even if i do that it's still pretty bad. For example on Bind i heard the metallic floor and i was hearing the footsteps like he was up in heaven but he was to my left on connector.\n\nAlso i wanna point out 2 things about Deathmatch, that minimap update every 5 secs or so was really not necessary, maybe show players who stay in the same spot for too long. Here i'm not sure but, is it just me or way too many people spawn behind you? Especially with this sound i don't even realize that they are behind me. I'm not gonna talk about the xp though.....OOF",

It doesn't seem like sound falls off much, like say someone is barely within range of you hearing them it's about as loud as if they are right next to you.\n\nCSGO it was much easier to tell exactly where people were from foot steps. It's not a constant issue in Valorant, but I've totally died in games holding a bad angle because the sounds lol. I'd almost say once a game.\n\nEdit - as top post I'd like to say that I love you Riot devs and you guys are overall kicking serious ass so far, keep up the good work!",

(1HP, audio cue on deploy, faces where you face, think mirage decoy from apex but honestly more inspired by Halo Reach hologram)\n\n\nRift: Open up a breach in space that Quantum can, at any time, travel back to by pressing [Q] while the skill is in use. The rift lasts 20 seconds and can be destroyed. (Meant more for defensive repositioning than offensive trading, animation plays before recall, glitch trails in direction of recall, no second life or automatic return)\n\n\nDimensional tear: Open up a map and mark 3 beacons on the map with [mouse 1] and deploy with [mouse 2]. Screens deploy between each beacon blocking vision. Max distance between each beacon is 15m, forming an equilateral triangle. Lasts 12 seconds. (Basically viper screens x brim smokes)\n\n\nTunneling: Open up a passage between open spaces on a surface, allowing all agents, bullets, and abilities to pass through. Passage lasts 30 seconds. (Loud audio cue, cast delay, and shown on map)\n\n(Edit: more clarifications)",

One of the most requested ideas in valrant is that riot needs to add a hunger bar. \n\nThis is what hunger bar in valrant would do. First if you dont eat then you get hungrey. After a while then your stomach grumbles so if your hideing in a corner, the enemeys can hear your stomach which reveals your position. Next if you dont eat for a few days in valrant then you die of starvation.\n\nHow do you get food thogh? Its prety easy, in all of the maps there is some grass that you can eat. Also if your in a sandy map like BIND then you can eat sand but it doesnt give you that much hunger becuse its sandy. Also your alowed to eat your team mates and enemeys if you kill them.\n\nOverall , hunger bar needs to be add to valrant and would make this game more fun and realstic.\n\nHere is what hunger bar in valrant would look like:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2m4bwvi3p4881.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4daaf2d766d5d3a17975de157e85eca9dca06a7d\n\nIf your wondereing why its so big its becuse then you always know how hungrey your charcter is.",

            "description": "Title pretty much makes the point, but I'll elaborate.\n\nNo, I didn't forget I have my res. Yes, I can see that you died. Yes, I understand how my ability works. If you don't get a res, there's probably one of three things going on, none of which are fixed by yelling or begging. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **You died in a bad spot**. If there are 3 enemies all dancing around your corpse, I am not going to put my gun away and charge in there with my little res hands wiggling around and get shot 37 times in the chest, just to waste my ult and also have you gunned down like a dog in the street before you can even take your gun out. I promise, your life is not worth having the team's healer executed by firing squad.\n2. **It would be a waste**. Not only are you not nearly as valuable as you think you are, but Sage's res is more valuable than you think too. Healers play the back line and don't get very many kills, so they don't charge their ult as fast. I can't just toss a grenade at people I don't even see and get 3 free kills that charge my ult halfway in 2 seconds. If you peaked like an idiot and died in the first second of the round, and then the round ends up being 4v1 and we have the site locked down, all the screaming in the world is not going to make me stop watching my corner so I can go get you up and save your judge. We don't need you, and *I am saving the res for when it will actually be useful.*\n3. **I don't like you.** Yes. That is sincerely a reason I will choose not to res you. If you instalocked raze as soon as you got into the character select screen, then immediately blew out your mic yelling \"HEY SOMEONE NEEDS TO PLAY SAGE\", then proceed to scream for heals every time your pinky toe touches a molly and you lose 3 health, leave the corner you're watching to come stand in front of me and stare and shoot at me until I heal you, and then scream bloody murder for a res when you get shot in the back of the head like the degenerate you are, you're damn right I am going to take one look at your lifeless corpse in front of me and step right over it like you're a piece of gum on the sidewalk. Because I'm a petty, vindictive, vengeful little man and I pick who I res, and I don't pick to reward you for your toxic playing. Is that also toxic of me? Yes. Do I care? Go fuck yourself.\n\nAll of this being said, there are just bad Sages out there that won't use their res, but yelling at them doesn't help either. No matter what, screaming like a child will do nothing to help your situation. Maybe try being a decent or useful teammate and your Sage will want to go out of their way to res you.\n\nEdit: An extra little PSA - if you hold down left alt you can see what abilities your teammates have ready. It's not ideal to have to check it like that, but it's better than asking 5 times ant not getting an answer",

She's 10 - has been  playing games like Fortnite for a couple of years. She is completely  supervised while playing and doesn't use the microphone.. but I have  encouraged her to use the Ping system which she uses a lot. She's  actually a really good Sage - she heals and revives behind walls ... and  even walls off choke points mostly correctly. One of her best plays was a 1v1 post plant where she walled off long C on Haven, threw a Slow Orb behind it and defused. It almost bought a tear to my eye.\n\nI have a gamer in the making and I will live out my esport professional dreams through her :D\n\nEDIT: My daughter is losing her mind at the attention this got. She's very happy. Thanks for all the nice comments :)\n\nEDIT #2: This blew up so I'm having trouble keeping up with all of the replies. Please know that I'm reading as many of them as I can and passing them along to my daughter. My daughter and I truly appreciate the positive response this got. Thank you to everyone who continues to comment as well. You're all amazing!",

            "description": "Not sure if this goes here but last night I was playing with a Jett (a dude in college), a Reyna (little kid, probably around 8), and a Cypher and Sage that didn’t use their mics.\n\nBusiness as usual, Jett and I are talking crap on voice comms while Reyna talks about fortnite. About halfway through the game, Jett asks Reyna if his parents are divorced. I was like broo chilll. Reyna says yeah. Jett asks if it’s the kid’s fault. There’s a long pause. The kid says, “I don’t know why my parents got divorced..” I ask Reyna if he’s okay, he responds by asking if I play fortnite. Jett asks him how he feels when he sees a belt. At this point I’m like holy shit I’m just going to start making callouts and change topics. \n\nJett later says that he’s having trouble at college because he’s a misogynist (as a joke).\n\nEventually, sage is making some big brain plays, and Reyna says “she’s so good!!” I was like, “how do you know she’s a girl?” Kid was right, she uses voice comms for the first time saying “yeah how do you know I’m a girl?” I bet that misogyny joke wasn’t so funny anymore \n\nIn the last few rounds, I advised Reyna to turn off his voice comms because strangers on the internet are mean.\n\n\n\n\nCyphers mic comes on for the first time, “my mic wasn’t working earlier, it’s okay he’s with me.” \nI was like “oh then it’s fine, who are you?” \n\n“I’m his dad.”\n\nShiiiiiiiiiit... Jett didn’t use his mic again that game\n\nEdit: u/cyberpoutine gives a good TLDR [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/hyc6oq/the_amount_of_second_hand_embarrassment_i_had/fzc45ic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) if the story might be confusing",

If i could buy 1 Radianite Point for 100 VP than yeah it would be 20% off but i can't buy 1 radianite for 100 RP. So for all for all intents and purposes, 20 RP = 1600VP, there is no 20% discount on them. \n\nThis is straight up predatory/missleading marketing. You want to make people think they are saving money when there is no way to even buy it for cheaper. And its not like this is a special offer that is only currently available either, these prices have been like this since the start of the game.\n\n\\-20% should be removed and -30% and -40% should be changed to reflect the actual money saved. Your prices are high enough as it is for skins, such advertising strats are something i expect from a mobile game company or EA not from a respectable developer.\n\nEdit: R.I.P my inbox, this blew up more than i expected.",

I actually stopped playing and decided I won’t be back until there’s a major patch that fixes this. The thing is- riot has never once acknowledged this problem. Even more difficult is the fact that it’s kind of hard to quantify what the problem is. I know what you’re talking about when I read your post, but it seems like half of players never even experience this (or at least are ok with turning a blind eye to it for some reason). I really hope this gets looked at because I truly like the game and want to play! It’s just super annoying and frustrating to have it feel so terrible to play in half of the matches.",

Skins, they got that in spades, we have no lacking content in skins  and the battle pass has some top tier ones. Hit registration has been explain and being worked on for better clarity.\n\nSound needs to be top priority right now. Sound is only second to hit registration. It is a huge deal and makes a huge difference. \"loud steps behind me\" oh it was actually in front of me. \"sounds in front of me\" nope was actually them running in ct.\n\nSound is way to big a deal to be put on the back burner. When I hear someone I should understand their direction and their aprox distance. A lot of games do this very well but not this one. No disrespect at all on the devs. I know this is on there list and will be fixed eventually but I think it needs to be at the top of the list.\n\nSince hit registration is basically working as intended with the exceptions, I think sound absolutely needs to be at the top of the to do list asap especially since this is a competitive game.\n\nEdit: Redditor advised me to add this as an example.

There are times where i want to play unrated but i just dont feel like spending half an hour to an hour in a full game. I think it would be a great addition if Riot added a (insert name of mode here) mode where it follows the same rules as unrated, but swaps at 6 rounds instead of 12. That way people who want to play an unrated but dont have the time or the mood to go the full 12+ rounds can enjoy the unrated style of gameplay. What are peoples thoughts on this?\n\nEDIT: Holy crap i didnt expect this to blow up. Thank you, for not only the awards but the nice discussion!

            "description": "**READ THE POST RATHER THAN COMMENTING BASED ON AN UNEDITABLE TITLE**\n\n\nSo I was curious about just how long it would take to hit level 50 on the battle pass so I decided to do the math out. It's all documented on [this excel sheet.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ODyws0Rip1N3cPeUyGyBptVtjgP0Mvfa/view?usp=sharing) It includes fields for how many games you play per week and what percentage of missions you complete among other variables. It can predict based on how many games you play what tier of the battle pass you will get.\n\n\nImportant Note: “...The battlepass will take ~100 hours to complete. Weekly XP's also scale up in every week to smooth out the experience curves. Just to give you an idea, the first set of weeklies offer 28,350 total XP and the last set of weeklies offer 60,750 total XP...” -Riot dev below .\n\n\nThis post and the calculator have been edited to account for the new info from Riot. Overall, with all the known sources of xp, it comes out to 138 hours through the calculator. Perhaps, there's additional unannounced content that will account for the 38 hour difference. Thank you riot for the clear communication, it really makes y’all stand out.\n\n\nHere's the summary though:\n\n* 1,372,000 XP is needed to get to level 50.\n* If you start today with a two month long battle pass, that's 171,500 XP per week.\n* Completing every weekly and daily mission yields ~75,000 XP per week. Riot has clarified that the weekly missions will increase from the 28,000 currently to 60,000. My math assumes it scales linearly over time.\n* With that in mind, it takes roughly 23 games of unrated per week in order to get to level 50. This assumes the average match is 13-8 and a 50% win/loss. This is also assuming you don't miss a single mission. Riot has stated weekly missions don't expire.\n* That represents 17 hrs of valorant per week from this calculator compared to the 16.3 from Riots numbers in order to fully complete it. Assuming you aren't going to grind hard, use the calculator to estimate which level you'd end up on.\n* Don't assume 50% of the time commitment means level 25, the xp/level and missions make it so you get much further than halfway for half the effort. \n\nIt’s confirmed ~two months [here.](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/what-is-the-valorant-battlepass/) “About every two months, an Act ends along with its associated battle pass.”\n\nTL;DR: Riot has clarified that the weekly mission xp will increase over time. It's roughly 17 hr/week by my calculator if you min/max compared to the 16 per/week from what Riots stated. Use the calculator to see how far you'll get.\n\nEdit 5:50 pm: This post has been edited heavily from the original for clarity and due to new information being provided from Riot. To the best of my knowledge, the calculator is correct and agrees with what Riot has stated about the battle pass. Obviously, if there are unannounced xp sources it'll go quicker.\nI chose to nuke all the old shit as clarity>record keeping.",

Through this post I will be discussing the importance of crosshair placement within the tac shooter genre, going over the most common mistakes I see people make in my experience as a coach, and offering structured routines to remedy the majority of these mistakes.  If you haven't read through any of my posts before ( I wouldn't they're too long ) I am an FPS player which mainly played CS:GO competitively, with around 7k hours and multiple level 10 faceit accounts and LAN wins in the past 5 years, who transitioned towards the end of my CS:GO days into being an FPS coach, I mainly worked with people trying to gain a competitive edge in CS, but later moved to coaching Apex players, and following the closed beta release of Valorant, I have been coaching Valorant players for the past few months, with unanimously positive feedback.  If you haven't read my first post which is a comprehensive general guide for players looking to improve in Valorant, I highly recommend you look at it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/gr93wz/an_indepth_guide_to_improving_in_valorant/) before continuing on to this post.  In relation to other qualifications / achievements, I have hit top 30 as hitscan DPS in Overwatch, maintained top 500 ranking in Apex ( PC ) for a couple of seasons, and hold numerous 1% rankings on various Kovaak's FPS Aim Trainer maps.  My main goal in creating these posts is to contribute to the Valorant community by sharing my knowledge gained over 10k collective hours of FPS experience ( mainly Tactical fps ) and hopefully help the people reading my posts improve and gain that competitive edge they need to progress into their desired ranking.  For those of you interested in learning more about my coaching service, or looking for a community of Valorant players looking to improve, I will link my Discord server at the end of this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why is crosshair placement important?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I was asked about the importance of consistent crosshair placement in games such as PUBG, Apex, Overwatch, Fortnite, etc.  I would probably answer by saying that while it's beneficial to maintain solid crosshair placement, it's by no means the most important aspect in relation to performing well in those games, in tactical shooters however, it's a whole different story.  Tactical shooters are low TTK ( time to kill ) games, and for the most part, a single bullet to the head is enough to eliminate a player, this means that in contrast to AFPS games, or games like Overwatch or Apex, which have a much higher TTK, first shot accuracy is of extreme importance in Valorant, inevitably leading to the fact that crosshair placement is also extremely important.  In a game with higher TTK, even if your first shot accuracy isn't perfect in an aim duel, you can win the fight if you land more shots on the opposing player over x amount of time that you trade with them, while in Valorant, whoever needs to make the least amount of adjustment to their crosshair when engaging in a 1v1 scenario wins the exchange.  It doesn't matter if your raw aim is out of this world, even if you have the most precise flicks known to the FPS community, if your crosshair placement is sub-optimal, you will lose vs. someone with consistent crosshair placement, this is simply due to the fact that all they need to do, is click once your head moves into their crosshair, often without even needing to move their mouse.  Crosshair placement may very well be the most important aspect in relation to gunplay and generally the mechanical aspect of tac shooters such as CS:GO or Valorant, as it's the deciding factor in the majority of aim duels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Common mistakes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA large amount of players tend to underestimate the importance of crosshair placement in Valorant, and especially the underlying complexity of maintaining consistency in that context.  People think that all you need to do to maintain solid crosshair placement is aim high enough to hit headshots, meaning that the only factor that affects crosshair placement is vertical positioning, others still stick to making their main source of information on game improvement being players who make statements as un-informative and vague as \"just click heads\", my main goal is to break down and explain the multiple factors that go into proper crosshair placement.  Lets start with the basics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Vertical Positioning:***\n\nAs mentioned above, one of the elements which ties into crosshair placement is vertical positioning. this is the set distance that you need to position your crosshair at in relation to the ground to be able to align your crosshair's horizontal axis with player model head-level.  The good thing about vertical positioning, is that you can get accustomed to the head level that the player models have in Valorant quite rapidly, as the hitbox sizes in this game are identical, meaning you can always use the ground as a point of reference to determine where the enemy player's head would be.\n\n[In Valorant, the head level always remains a set distance from the ground ](https://preview.redd.it/w4hvvg5mh3b51.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e218d75e52782dd504723f1af42acfa03b848f3)\n\nIn order to train your general ability to place your crosshair at the correct height, try to make a habit out of constantly reminding yourself to place your crosshair at head level, regardless of where you are or what you're doing on the map.  What I mean by this, is that even if there isn't any imminent threat of enemy players peeking you, try to keep constantly keep your crosshair at head level, the more time you spend doing this, the faster it will become a habit and become something you do subconsciously, without having to actively focus on the action.  This habit allows you to build muscle-memory during otherwise useless down-time, another way to do this is to track your teammate's heads with your crosshair while rotating, leaving spawn etc.\n\nWhile vertical positioning is something that people get used to relatively easily, I have come across a recurring issue among the VODs of people I coach, and that is that people generally struggle with adapting the vertical component of their crosshair's position to varying points of elevation.  Here's an image to help you visualize a scenario where this could be an issue:\n\n[Peeking C Long, Positions marked: Cubby \\( right \\), Platform \\( left \\), back-site \\( back \\)](https://preview.redd.it/yxvbjtkuj3b51.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=32e6481cf265009e326458dd271b49058dd9eed7)\n\nIn the image above I am peeking into C back-site from C long on the map 'Haven', I have highlighted three different positions / angles where an enemy could potentially peak from in an in-game reenactment of this scenario, Platform, Cubby, and back-site.  What you'll notice is that these positions all have different points of elevation, meaning that while using the ground as reference will allow me to maintain my crosshair at head-level if someone peeks my position from ground level on C site, in order to clear cubby and platform, I would need to adjust my crosshair accordingly, using their lower levels as a reference for where the head-level position would be in those angles.\n\nUnfortunately, if you are struggling with this due to the fact that you aren't familiar with the map layout yet, the only thing that will remedy your situation is more time spent playing the game, if however, your issue stems from a mechanical inability, meaning that your mouse control isn't good enough to allow you to make such adjustments comfortably, the routine provided later in the guide may help you get past that issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Horizontal Positioning:***\n\nJust as with vertical positioning, horizontal positioning is pretty self-explanatory in terms of it's function.  Knowing at what height to position your crosshair at in relation to the environment is far easier to do than knowing where to position it on a horizontal axis, the reasoning behind this is that with vertical placement you will always have the ground or lower level of the object the opponent is standing on as a point of reference which allows you to instantly know at what height head-level is.  When focusing on the horizontal aspect of crosshair placement, there isn't a set point of reference at all times; Sometimes you need to hold wide angles, sometimes you need to move along with the object you're playing against, and sometimes you need to pre-aim to swing effectively, all this variability makes it much harder for a newer player to grasp crosshair placement and horizontal positioning is just as crucial as vertical positioning if not even more important.\n\nA very common mistake which I see a lot of in the VODs I review as a coach, is newer players holding angles too tightly, meaning that they're playing in a position where they anticipate an enemy push and are waiting for the engagement, and their crosshair is a position where it's hugging the edge of the wall the enemy will peek from.  Here is a visual representation of what I'm talking about:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Example of incorrect horizontal placement](https://preview.redd.it/70km6422y3b51.png?width=1249&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0bb1e618fb1a3084f30ac1e29feffad9224745c)\n\nIn the image above, I'm holding an angle where if someone crosses moving parallel to the wall I'm looking at, I'll have under 50 ms to react, my crosshair is so close to the edge of the wall that I will need to click my LMB the milli-second I see the enemy.  By holding this angle, chances are that by the time I click the enemy will have already crossed to the left of my crosshair resulting in a miss and most likely my death;  It would take inhuman reaction times for anyone to hit a player while holding like this, especially if the enemy player is swinging.  Instead, you should allow some distance from your crosshair to the edge of the angle you're holding, allowing yourself to spot the enemy's player model, and then time your click effectively.  Here is a visual representation of correct crosshair placement while holding the same angle:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Example of correct horizontal placement](https://preview.redd.it/ar2c4k38z3b51.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=2261f808ff9713041227512497849d0281822698)\n\nAs you can see, in the image above I am allowing for some space between the wall and my crosshair, giving me a significantly longer time window to spot an enemy player and react.  Holding an angle that's too \"tight\" would mean I need to make a larger adjustment to hit the enemy, and therefore I increase my margin of error due to vertical overshoot ( see below ).  There are exceptions to the rule when it comes to the distance you need to hold at, if the angle you are holding only allows forward movement ( into your crosshair ) you can hold a narrow line of sight.  If you are clearing an angle ( moving along it to check for enemies ) and you are the agressor, you can hold tight and move along with the wall / LOS to allow for a faster reaction if you spot an enemy during your movement.  If you are the agressor and you want to swing into an angle that you believe / know an enemy is holding, it is sometimes optimal to pre-aim, meaning you position your crosshair in a way where without moving your mouse it will be aimed at the enemy's head once you swing out the angle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Vertical Offset:***\n\nThe final common issue I would like to bring up which ties into both crosshair placement and horizontal click-timing, is something I call \"vertical offset\" or \"vertical overshoot\", this is a player's inability to move his crosshair horizontally while maintaining the same vertical placement.  Vertical offset is a big issue when it comes to switching angles or flicking horizontally, I have seen many scenarios where a player is holding an angle properly with their crosshair at a pixel-perfect vertical position in relation to head level, only to make a 30 degree turn to check a different angle and end up shooting at an enemy's chest and losing the duel.  Usually, the larger the movement, the more the player's crosshair deviates vertically. Here is a depiction of what vertical offset / overshooting looks like in-game:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Example of margin of error caused by vertical offset \\/ overshooting](https://preview.redd.it/3z5hcrtm04b51.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=d353f61660d02cd8cb1749f0af387882a7d9b072)\n\nIn the image above the green dot is where the crosshair should end up in an ideal scenario while flicking from it's current position to the target dummy, while the green lines represent a theoretical margin of error for overshooting.  Fortunately for people that face this issue, I have come up with multiple Kovaak's maps and firing range excercises to help combat it and largely reduce your margin of error when moving your crosshair / flicking horizontally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Settings: What sensitivity / crosshair should I use?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis part of the post discusses a topic which is highly subjective, both the sensitivity you use and the crosshair you use are something preference-based that you should decide upon on your own, the reason I'm adding this section into the post is for players which are newer to the tac-shooter genre;  There are a few guidelines that will help them narrow down the settings that work the best for them.\n\nFirst off, don't by any means copy your favorite pro's config, just because something works for a professional player that has probably spent well above 10,000 hours playing FPS games and decided upon their ideal sensitivity and crosshair within that massive period of time, doesn't mean that it's going to work for you, use whatever you're most comfortable with.  Other than individual preference, and having gotten used to their sensitivity, the Pros you watch may be using gear which feels different at their sensitivity setting.  A lighter mouse, faster mouse-pad, and faster feet can feel very different in terms of mouse movement, even if you're playing on the same sensitivity value on paper.  In relation to grip-styles and what mice are ideal for each hand size, make sure to check out my first post in this sub before moving forward with this guide, as playing on hardware that caters to your individual preferences plays an important role in increasing your mechanical potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Sensitivity:***\n\nAs I stated in the paragraph above, sensitivity is something quite subjective and while there's no general rule as to which single sens value is superior, Valorant and CS:GO professionals tend to stick to e-dpi or cm/360 much lower than professional players in other titles and FPS subgenres.  Your e-dpi is your in-game sensitivity value multiplied by your mouse's DPI setting.  The average e-dpi used by Valorant professionals is around 250 e-dpi, which would be a value of 0.625 in-game @ 400 DPI, or around 50 cm/360.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pro player & Streamer sensitivity settings \\(e-dpi\\)](https://preview.redd.it/5fi30zwee4b51.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=17893f3adb9090f9b35e8bde6eb0c4d5e0ae4bb1)\n\ncm/360 is a universal format for sensitivity measurement, it's the amount of centimeters you need to move your mouse in order to perform a full rotation.  This is the format adopted within aimer communities due to the simple fact that you asking someone \"what sensitivity do you play on?\" And them responding with \"1.5 in CSGO\" is pretty useless information as they could be playing at any DPI range, and you don't necessarily know what each CSGO sens corresponds to in relation to physical movement, or even movement in other games.  \"e-dpi\" solves the issue of different DPI x Sens measurements within the same game, but the cm/360 format is easily transferable from title to title.\n\nThe reason professional players in the tac shooter genre use lower sens on average, is due to the fact that in contrast with other FPS games, tac shooters don't require larger or extended movements, instead they require you to hold or clear angles while maintaining stable crosshair placement, the least adjustments you need to make to your crosshair's position on your screen, the better your \"aim\" will be.  The majority of players I have coached report that it has been significantly easier for them to maintain consistent crosshair placement at lower sensitivities.  For newer players that still haven't found a \"main\" sensitivity that they feel comfortable on, I would recommend for them to stick to the range of 200-300 e-dpi, while for more experienced players coming from CS or other similar games, I would recommend a similar range with a higher cap, at 200-400 e-dpi ( very few professional players play above 300 e-dpi ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Crosshair settings:***\n\nThis is something even more subjective and preference-based than sensitivity even, so what I will do in this section is simply post my own settings which I use for my in-game crosshair, and explain why I picked each value within the menu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Crosshair Settings](https://preview.redd.it/kijho7df64b51.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbfadd32489fe6aacf9ff69fd52380c9e76f8d7f)\n\nSo, lets break my crosshair down setting by settings:\n\n* **Color**:  I use \"Cyan\" as it stands out quite well for me with my current color settings, any color that doesn't match your enemy outline color works perfectly fine here.\n* **Inner Line Opacity:**  This setting basically determines how see through your crosshair will be, I like setting mine at \"1\" as It makes the crosshair stand out more.\n* **Inner Line Thickness:**  I set this to \"1\" which is the lowest value, a lot of professional players like to use \"2\", I think setting the value to \"1\" makes it easier to align your crosshair with heads or with other objects in the environment, it is also less obstructive, so I highly recommend either this or \"2\" to newer players\n* **Inner Line Offset:**  This setting determines how large the gap is in your crosshair, I like setting this to \"1\" as the gap is as small as possible without disappearing, larger gaps make it more difficult to determine where the exact center of your screen is, which can act as a hnderance in your first shot accuracy at longer range engagements.\n* **Movement & Firing Error:**  These settings just turn your crosshair into a dynamic crosshair and make the gap widen significantly while moving or shooting respectively in order to give you a visual representation of how the innacuracy factor works.  Useless and distracting, would highly suggest that you keep these both off unless you're very new and still don't understand how movement / spray accuracy works.\n* **Outer Lines:**  Everything is off here, I don't think playing with outer lines provides any benefit whatsoever and it's an extra distraction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Crosshair Placement Improvement Routine:\n\nA large portion of improving your crosshair placement is based on simply playing the game more, crosshair placement is largely based on muscle memory, part of having good crosshair placement is simply based on having experience in-game allowing it to become a subconscious habit, and the rest is based on your ability to anticipate player model movement and learn to make horizontal movements without simultaneously your crosshair vertically.  The routine I will provide is not only a great way to work on your crosshair placement, but also highly beneficial to the click-timing aspect of your aim, which is basically the only element of aiming required in Valorant, as good tracking is unecessary in such a low TTK game.  If you are already training using a daily routine on Kovaak's ( as you should be ) you can just implement this into your daily scenarios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Kovaaks:***\n\n( These are all maps which require you to make horizontal movements without overshooting vertically, thus good aim training for those struggling with crosshair placement, see my other posts for a larger variety of Kovaaks maps )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1 wall 2 targets horizontal - 10 minutes ( focus on your flicks, work on hitting both targets in the same movement, not pausing in between )\n* Valorant Small flicks - 10 minutes ( Great routine as head level is that of Valorant, and vertical deviation will cause you to miss, forcing you to maintain head level as you play through it )\n* PatTarget Switch small - 10 minutes ( Works on your ability to swap from one target to another while maintaining head level crosshair placement, keep LMB held while playing, only go for heads )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***HSDM:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Valorant doesn't currently offer it's own deathmatch servers, therefore the next best thing is practicing in CS:GO.  HSDM is a headshot only modifier for community FFA servers in CS:GO.  To access these maps go to \"Community Server Browser\" and simply type in \"HSDM\", any server with decent population will do ( preferably 128 tick ).  Playing FFA on headshot only forces you to maintain head-level crosshair placement as body shots don't count.  I advise going for taps rather than spraying, as it limits the RNG, also spraying in CS:GO isn't transferable to Valorant as a mechanic.  Make it a challenge for yourself to maintain positive K/D while playing.  Use the AK in rifle servers, and the USP-S in pistol servers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Firing Range:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Set the target dummy position to static, and practice your click timing by only going for the targets furthest to the left and furthest to the right interchangeably, do this for around 10 minutes.\n* Play Spike Rush and set it to hard.  When set on \"Hard\" the AI will one shot you as soon as you peek if it has seen you, and one shot you after around half a second if you shift-peek it.  Pretty decent warmup in relation to crosshair placement as you will die every single time if you aren't instantly headshotting the targets the moment you peek.  Play this for another 10 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Link to my Discord server for further questions / coaching inquiries:\n\n# ------------> [https://discord.gg/6ZYVZ6x](https://discord.gg/6ZYVZ6x)\n\nNew twitter : https://mobile.twitter.com/Twix_v2",

Kovaak's, HSDM and the firing range can all help you to gain a better control of your crosshair and might improve your raw aim, but in order to have good crosshair placement you need to know the angles that are being held in the maps you are playing and that comes with studying the maps and lots of trial and error. I could have the best dexterity and raw aim but if I don't know the angles of the maps I am playing on then it's going to be very hard to have good crosshair placement when clearing angles and holding corners. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfLgNu11EZA) guide made by Launders on Swag's crosshair placement back in CS shows the basics of where you should be holding angles and although Valorant is a bit different the fundementals still hold true.",

She also created the arm tablet used by the agent Brimstone, a soldier for the Kingdom organization.  Now, for KAY/O. KAY/O is an automated killing machine from our very own Kingdom organization. But who in the Kingdom organization is specialized in robotics? That would be killjoy, the inventor and user of two different drones used for combat. It all adds up, right? But here's what doesn’t make sense. Why does this robot wear pants? The training ground robots don’t have any pants, and there's nothing there. So really, there’d be nothing for him to hide. Unless, there was.  It’d only make sense for KAY/O to cover up if he had something to cover up. This is why it's almost certain the KAY/O android has had uses besides killing. More specifically, KAY/O had to have been a sex robot designed and used by Killjoy. This is also the reason for its human-like appearance. A robot built for war would have weapons built in, would it not? But it doesn’t. Why would it have weapons built in if it was built for keeping company with a lonely girl in a workshop?",

            "description": "**EDIT:** People are commenting without reading my post. Addressing the more common comments: I am **NOT** saying that Reyna is OP. I am fully aware that she is a liability if her aim isn't on point, as well as the fact that she has no utility if doesn't get any kills. Ideally Leer would be toned down and the other aspects of her kit would somehow be reworked/changed to compensate. Arguing that different abilities are better is difficult because they are used for different things and are therefore not directly comparable - this is the most subjective part of the post. I'm not claiming that my opinion is correct and yours aren't, simply stating mine. It's highly likely that in a month from now I will look like a moron because we've optimised Cypher and Sova to new levels or something like that. Arguing about my opinion is not relevant to the main point of the argument. \n\nPeople who choose to attack my skill level instead of my arguments need to learn what an ad hominem is, because that's not a real argument, it's a logical fallacy. And if it appeases you, [here](https://imgur.com/a/3ZDTB37) is my most recent game and [here](https://imgur.com/a/3TG9d5Q) [is](https://imgur.com/a/IuTUfES) my full match history. This argument is **NOT** a rant/cry being made from the person on the receiving end of the stomping. Also the argument that non-professional players should have no basis for balancing is just wrong. Balancing for pros and casuals is not mutually exclusive and is how game designers earn their money. Finally, having 1 person shoot the flash and 1 person peek is **NOT** valid counterplay because requiring a man advantage to properly counter something that costs so little and has so little risk is not balanced. You can just as easily argue that if Reyna also has a teammate then they are at a huge advantage because 1 enemy will have his dick in his hand aiming at the air. If you can't be bothered to read the whole post, I've bolded the most important parts. However, commenting something rude or dismissive when you haven't even bothered to read the post is not constructive. \n\n**END RANT**\n\n\nI am writing this in the hopes that Reyna's flash is addressed in the next balance patch. As Riot have stated that they are keeping an eye on agent winrates to decide balancing changes, hopefully if we can all abuse Reyna's Leer properly in our matches, we can see it receive the nerfs that it needs.\n\n**Why Reyna's flash is broken:**\n\n1. The biggest offender: **it doesn't flash Reyna or her teammates**. This means that there is literally **0 risk** to using it. With other flashbangs like Phoenix, Breach or Omen, if you time the flash wrong, it will hit your teammates. However, if the Attackers decide to push somewhere, Reyna can literally just throw the flash through the wall while her teammates push, forcing you to either reveal your location and mess up your crosshair placement by shooting it, or to fall back, giving up site and giving the attackers a heavily advantageous post plant situation.\n\n\n2. It **travels through walls**. This means that Reyna can cast it from safety. Again, this means that there is 0 risk to Reyna for casting Leer.\n\n3. Because it is active for multiple seconds, **you can't simply turn away** and quickly peek like other traditional flashbangs. Therefore playing antiflash positions and off angles on defender side is extremely risky. \n\n4. It **only costs $200**. This is partly due to Reyna's kit but she can often get away with only buying light armour and opting for Leers instead as she can effectively gain full armour from just 1 frag. It offers far too much reward for such little cost and risk.\n\nOften I see things like \"just shoot the eye\" or \"just position better.\" Neither of these are valid counterplay, as you are giving up something while Reyna and the attackers are under **0 risk**. You either give up your location, or you give up the position you were holding, either way the attackers gained a significant advantage for **LITERALLY NO RISK.**\n\n**How to abuse Leer:**\n\nOn attacker side, be mindful that you only have 2 Leers, and use them wisely. **Throw them through the walls into the open while your teammates push through chokepoints**. 2 Leers will get you onto a bombsite for free. Otherwise, if you get to the last chokepoint with only 1 Leer, using the second one while your teammates are taking fights on site will catch the enemy off guard for some easy frags, again for 0 risk. \n\nIf you're playing a default, Leer is ridiculously good at getting map control. You just **choose somewhere that the defenders aren't allowed to peek at the start of the round, throw Leer, and the defenders are literally just not allowed to peek**. For example it's very strong to throw a Leer middle on Ascent at the start of the round and have your teammate peek with an awp. Using the combination of free map control and free escapes through chokepoints strategically makes attacking so much easier for your team. \n\n\nReyna is not as good on the defender side as she lacks utility like smokes or molotovs. However, Leer is still absurdly good. The best way I've found to abuse it is to have two people behind cover waiting for footsteps. **If you hear footsteps, Reyna throws the eye from behind cover, and you double peek them as it pops.** This way you get a double peek while the enemies are either blinded/aiming in the air/running to cover. Bear in mind this is risky and if there are more than 2 or 3 attackers one of you will likely die. Sometimes it is better to throw a leer to stall the enemy and simply retreat to site. However, combined with a strong defensive agent like Cypher, Reyna can still shine on the defender side. EDIT: People also raised a valid point that Reyna's Leer is very strong counterplay to an enemy's Leer. If they throw a Leer then you can wait a second, throw yours, and then swing with your teammates. \n\n\nOn retake, if you coordinate with your team, it's usually possible to **throw a Leer that covers around the middle of the site**, which will affect enemies aiming at most potential retake entrances. If you do so as all of the defenders push at once, again there is literally 0 risk and massive reward, as Leer will actively **gain information from enemies shooting at it or running away from it** for **0 risk**. It's the same idea as using it on attacker side but a little bit harder to coordinate the timing properly.\n\nYou can always use Leer to **take aggressive map control**, however I've found that defending sites is *generally* stronger than in CS where map control is extremely important. In this case you'd use it the same as on the attacker side. Having two people push behind the enemy just for the enemies to go mid and onto the site you just left is far more common in Valorant than I've ever seen in years of CS. The maps are just so big. However, map control is always extremely powerful, and Leer again gives it to you for free.\n\n\nI feel like a broken record but Reyna's flash is truly the most egregious ability I've seen in Valorant, again, because there is LITERALLY 0 DOWNSIDE for using it. I can't stress this enough. Everything should have a fair risk/reward ratio. It's not fair that Reyna can just throw the bullshit flash through the wall while 4 of her teammates push and you either have to let them all the way up to site or you have to reveal your position by shooting at the eye, at which point against competent players you're going to have utility thrown at you and your head will be blown off the second you peek. While I understand things like reviving as design philosophy choices, Reyna's flash just breaks the boundaries of what a flash is. It is so much better than every other flash it's laughable. \n\n**In terms of how I would balance it,** I would make the flash **not go through walls**. Therefore, Reyna would have to expose herself to throw a good Leer. This would still be extremely strong but not broken. \n\nGo out and abuse Reyna in unrated and hopefully Riot will address this in the next balance change.\n\n\nEDIT: A lot of responses here, some raise valid arguments. However it's just funny to see people comment about my skill level as if that's a relevant fact. Maybe try arguing the points I make instead of dismissing it because you think I'm a low rank? \n\nSomeone did raise a good point about just waiting and counterflashing. But if you look at the OP one of the ways that I said to use Leer was essentially as a counterflash. Furthermore, different flashes have the RISK of BLINDING YOUR TEAMMATES if you use them as a counterflash, which Leer doesn't. \n\nAnd **to be clear, I'm not arguing that Reyna is overpowered**. It's just that her Leer is a completely polarizing ability as it is significantly better than the rest of her kit. A better way to balance her would be to tone down Leer and boost some of the other aspects of her kit. \n\nOf course everything I've said is my opinion and the game has been out less than a week. But conceptually, a flash that doesn't blind teammates is always going to be extremely strong in a team based shooter. Add the other benefits that I outlined (active for multiple seconds, large range, goes through walls, cheap) and it simply provides too much utility for the risk and cost.\n\nBecause people are fixated on my skill level, I use Reyna and I [abuse the shit out of her](https://imgur.com/a/3ZDTB37) too, because I like winning and she's a fun character. Please focus on my arguments instead of my skill level.\n\nI can't believe that people have taken this post seriously enough to literally sit there for 4 hours and comment something negative on every one of the comments I made while downvoting, but it's happened, so I'll be muting this thread now.",

Set yourself up so if she were to Leer onto site you can fall back ever so slightly while still holding just about the same angle. Or set up on pixel peeks and blindfire through the Leer. There's definitely ways to deal with them almost anywhere she can throw them. Unlike most flashes, they ONLY effect you while directly in your LOS. If you play a closer angle the Leer may be placed too deep to affect you, or if you use the map to your advantage you may find a spot to peek that blocks off the Leer. \n\nI think people are overall too quick to judge her in a game as complicated and intricate as this. Everyone's first reaction to her stems from them not having the experience to properly deal with her, and as she gets used more and more, the community will start to become less susceptible to getting leered while they wide swing through mid and may instead opt to use their own utility to bait/combat hers.",

These teammates who do this are usually botfrag duelists who don't entry.\n\nSo, I did a little experiment. A few rounds per game in different locations, I would drop something as simple as a Cavelier vandal on a dead body and camp there. Half of the time someone would fall for this the first time.  Make sure the gun is low on bullets so they will reload when they pick it up. Hide behind a corner, and the moment you hear the gun pickup and reload, swing and get your free kill. \n\nI know this is a really stupid idea of killing people, but it actually works if you don't overuse it. Have fun, and this works best with expensive skins.",

Sova was ranked immortal 2 and the diamond 1/2's that popped off were being toxic because he couldn't clutch the 5th round in a 1v4 scenario with a stinger and a dream.\n\nNow we move on to the next round and he's 100 short from a full buy. He requests for a drop, sadly I had made a bad eco choice 2 rounds prior and I was just barely able to buy my kit so the only people with money were 2 low diamond fraggers  instead of buying him they called him boosted and proceeded to not buy him the gun.\n\nSo the way the 6th round played out was like this:\n\n\\- Low diamond fraggers push and get 1 tapped.\n\n\\- I manage to take out their Sage and phoenix before dying because my dumbass couldn't afford utility since I had money fucked myself.\n\n\\- Our sage gets raze Ulted.\n\n\\- Sova ends up in a 1v3.\n\n\\- He takes out their Brimstone and Cypher and is left at 45 hp.\n\n\\- Bomb is ticking down, he has to go for the fight with Raze. (bomb is down on C of haven planted for long.)\n\n\\- He pump fakes the bomb, Raze pops out of long C cubby, scuffs his shots, Sova manages to start return fire but misses the headshot.\n\n\\- Comes out to this iron tier spray and pray battle where raze takes probably half his clip to kill the sova.\n\n\\- After the round was over I asked Sova how much damage he had done.\n\n\\- He says 140.\n\nIf he had been able to afford full armor with a drop, we could've likely won that round.\n\nNow fast forwarding to the end of that game we lost 13-12, it was a heart-breaker. Sova ended up as match MvP with a KDA of 28/21/11 and the 2 low diamonds ended up bottom fragging.\n\nHAD we won that round, there was a very high chance that we took the game. We lost it because 2 toxic low diamond players couldn't get over the fact that someone ranked higher than them could have a couple bad rounds.\n\nI'm not going to lie, the two added me at the end and wanted to queue together and I may or may not have had an amazing revenge porn moment of telling them that I don't queue with bottom fraggers.",

If he's in the top 3% that means there is still around 50,000 at a higher level then he is. And there are tons of young players in the Valorant community. \n\nI wouldn't let your son play excessive hours just because he is Diamond 2, if your son has managed to improve to that level by his current playtime, he doesn't need a major hour increase to get even better, and when school starts getting hard and his study becomes important, you would rather he be good at managing his short time then be reliant on long hours for improvement.\n\nAlso burnout is a really big factor, when I was young at the age of 12 I was global elite in csgo. Sounds really impressive right? But no one knows who the fuck I am. I tried translating from competitive ranked player into tournaments and leagues and it was a horrible experience. The e sports scene is already a toxic environment that's super hard to break into, but when your at a young age it's even more toxic. You need a thick skin, I remember the first time I played with a pro player I looked up to in-game, he literally abused me and trash talked me in game for how bad I was, it ruined my confidence. I quit cs:go later down the line only at the age of 13 because I was burnt out from trying to join teams, dealing with multiple toxic experiences, having teams disband one after another, it was just very toxic.\n\nAll this stuff is really good for developing you later up, a child with thick skin is always a good thing, as long as he doesn't end up becoming toxic himself. At the end of the day I think you should support his e sports career, but know that there are tons of people out there grinding at already a higher level then your son. Valorant isn't going to die in 2-3 years so don't stress it if he's not pro tomorrow. Personally I would still restrict your son's time, make sure he has the right priorities in life and he's not putting all his eggs in one basket. Let him have fun at the young age instead of being super worried about his esports. If in some time he's still improving and growing and he's ready to make that step into high level competitive play then you can have this conversation again.\n\nAll in all he's still your child, and Valorant is a game which has a lot of young players coming out of no where, but just be careful around burn out and time management.",

My qualms with the 'za are twofold, and I would like to share them with you (the community) below:\n\n1. Ascent takes place in Italy, a country renowned for it's cuisine. Pizza is so quintessentially Italian that a non-profit was established in 1984 just to ensure that all pizzas claiming to be Neapolitan in style uphold the true virtues of the cuisine. This is a country that prides itself on delicious, homemade recipes passed down through generations. This open-box tragedy would make any Italian pizza chef worth his salt throw his apron down in disgust.\n2. If one were to look closely, one would see that the open-box pizza is actually *still steaming*. This suggests that the pizza isn't old, it hasn't been sitting out for ages in the Italian sun getting dry, oh no; this pizza is as fresh as the day is long. And yet it still looks like a dehydrated husk of dough and dollar store mushrooms.\n\nAs a lover of both pizza and Valorant, I beg you (the community) to consider how cool upgrading this dusty, misbegotten pie and replacing it with something more delicious-looking; a pizza that inspires the palate. Let's hope someone one day turs this pizza into an *ace* of a dish.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n&#x200B;",

The problem for me is a lot of them who do it are big streamers like Hiko (Radiant) Pokimane (Diamond) and Wardell (Radiant) but at least Wardell was clearly messing around and not trying. However, apparently, Hiko was going 27-6 when he did smurf. In total, the 3 of them average about 30K-50K  viewers so imagine how many people might see this and think \"hey smurfing looks fun\" and ruins every low Elo player's day.\n\n\n\nEdit: Okay so apparently some of the people I mentioned are boosted. I did not know this and im sorry that people are getting offended that I said poki was diamond.\n\nEdit #2: Thank you for all of the awards :D\n\nEdit 3:  just so it’s clear, I haven’t faced a smurf in months.

            "description": "Edit: thank you all for the support and awards.My account is brand new so my replies are not showing for some reason. I'm gonna dig deeper in the system Ea is currently using and posts ips of their servers for people to approve my findings on their own. \n\nAs soon as you start fifa and see Connecting to Ea servers on screen, you ping multiple servers around the world to determine your matchmaking region. The regions are as follow:\n\n- Europe (Germany): 18.197.48.114 Hosted by Amazon\n- Europe (Ireland): 52.18.194.209 Hosted by Amazon\n- Europe (France) : 52.47.70.141 Hosted by Amazon\n- Asia (Singapore): 52.220.199.97 Hosted by Amazon\n- Asia (Hong-Kong): 43.239.136.227 Hosted by Amazon\n- Asia (India-Mumbai): 13.233.50.52 Hosted by Amazon\n- Asia (Japan) : 13.230.248.238 Hosted by Amazon\n- Asia (Dubai): 185.179.203.80\tHosted by I3d\n- Australia: 13.211.232.151 Hosted by Amazon\n- USA (oregon) : 54.189.201.217 Hosted by Amazon\n- USA (virginia) : 18.206.67.50 Hosted by Amazon\n- South Africa : 185.179.200.226 Hosted by I3d\n- Mexico: 169.57.76.171 Hosted by SoftLayer Technologies\n- South America (Brazil): 52.67.114.134 Hosted by Amazon\n\nYou think they cover the entire world but there is alot of dead zones forcing people to play on servers located 1000+km away. Like half of Russia, Turkey and countries in this region shown in picture. https://ibb.co/jJ8nCy0\nNot to mention africa while most south africans think they play On european servers when they are not. they have delay because they play people in africa that are connecting from 2000+ kms... \n\nIn a 1vs1 game the choice of dedicated servers is really bizarre from Ea. They spent a fortune because they are afraid of p2p cheaters. lag switchers and ddosing opponent ip. I believe the choice of dedis was mainly to cover opponent ip and to make people not able to ddos all opponents on WL and finish 30/30 with cheats. But a server between two players creates a huge issue when only one player have a high ping. If player one ping 25ms to the server and player 2 pings 175ms. there will be effectevily 200ms ping for a packet to reach from player 1 to the server then to player 2 and vice vers ca. If both players have a cumilative ping of 300ms then you can imagine how bad the delay is. Even when both have 75ms (4 bars) 150ms is not ideal. So they need to enable p2p for the people playing from places with pings higher than 100ms to the closest server, or at least group them together and let the majority of the players have lag free games. When I say the majority it's because most sales fifa make are in france, germany, UK, netherlands, spain... aka Europe. \n\nThe matchmaking at least in rivals as I can't deal with Wl delay anymore is totally random. it doesnt take into account the quality of your opponent internet neither his ping. it doesnt matter if you see 5 bars (sub 50ms ping) or 4 bars (sub 75ms ping). If your opponent have high ping or packet loss/ping jitter you will play a delayed match. Poeple here wonder why late at night or early morning the game feel extremly smooth. it's because at these times there is less chance you or your opponent family members using your internet to stream videos or download/upload anything. If you don't set Qos in your router to give your console/pc the priority in sending/recieving data and you don't let other connected deviced leeches your entire internet bandwidth you will have packet loss and speed up lag/delay problems. Also outside of peak times all isps networks are not overloaded so ping is always less than at 7-12pm. \n\nIt's sad how the game instantly match me with someone else in rivals! it's 2019, give us the option to search for optimal connectivity. Don't match me with someone far away or with packet loss then apply lag compensation on my input. I play a delayed game then ping the server I was playing on and see that I have 0% packet loss and stable low ping, this drives me nuts. The system Ea use compensate alot for packet loss. How do I know? they said it themselves. Here is the link to their pitch note from july 2019: https://fifaforums.easports.com/en/discussion/489256/gameplay-responsiveness-efforts-july-2019\n\nThey clearly confess using a maximum buffer time higher than what is needed to match the smoothness of an offline match. they say slightly higher but I call bs. The matches online can be delayed by a full second. You can see how much delay is added as soon as the referee call full time, discusting stutter. Why punish us because of my opponent packet loss? Why match me with someone with 150ms ping? Why revert the changes that made us play for 4 days delay free matches?\n\nHere is a list of Ea servers that host rivals matches for everyone to test,You can use pingplotter. they are stable, they are amazon AWS, some of the best in the industry:\n- 35.181.31.5 France\n- 15.188.58.59 France\n- 34.248.118.84 Ireland\n- 18.185.22.123 Germany\n- 3.120.87.86 Germany.\n \nEnd of edit\n\n\nI joined reddit to post this, I worked in game development before and my field is networking. Im a fut addict like most of you. English is not my first language and this is gonna be a long read. \n\nI started playing Fut 3 years ago and ever since I did all I could to find a solution on my end for the input delay. But nothing worked, some games are smooth, some are slightly delayed and most are unplayable. \n\nI started digging last year but on this post I'm gonna focus on this years Ea servers and netcode. This season they added new servers in my region (europe) they are located in france and hosted by amazon. there is also amazon servers they are usin in germany and I3d servers in holland. Few servers in Ireland run by bioware.\n\nIn my tests the amazon servers in France have very bad routing for all connections going through Italy, once they reach amazon backbone in palermo, the packets go all around europe up till Ireland then back to france. which adds multiple unnessecary hops and ping. very bizarrre routing from amazon. \n\nIn my country The netherland servers hosted by I3d are the best, extremly short route (8 hops) and consistent ping. Actually all the servers have no jitter in all the testings I did in different times and days.\n\nMaking sure I only play on I3d servers I still have variance in gameplay smoothness while my ping is always the same. So this led to me asking, wtf?\n\nThere is two issues with the current system EA using. The first one is the matchmaking parameters: they never take in to account both players pings to the server. They use geo filter to match people together and even that filter is soft and ignored 99% of the time. this brings one huge issue: one player with sub 20ms ping to the server can play with another with 200 ms ping. And this leads to another greater issue. The person with lowest ping will have an artificial ping added to him of 180ms to make the match in sync with his opponent. this leads to huge input delay for player 1 and smooth game for player 2. The lag comoensation imaximum buffer is too high for a smooth 1vs1 game online.\n\nAnother finding is that the game not only compensate for latency but also for bad connectivity, the maximum buffer time allowed in the game to resend data is case of an error is too high in an effort to make people with unstable internet don't suffer alot of speed up lag.\n\nI have read the pitch notes From Ea about this issue from july in fifa 19, they actually lowered the maximum buffer time allowed to resend data in case of an error last  summer for 4 days, but they were hammered by pwople complaining about speed up lag and finally reverted the changes. In this case they saw the problem from potential profits point of view. Less people able to play online is less profits from them. More people able to play eveb if with delayed gameplay is much better economically for them. \n\n\nWhy Im posting this? from the contacts of my friends who still work in game dev industry. Ea has stopped looking at this issue, they want more players to be able to play this game and they dont care about the responsivness. The networking departement already found the solution last year but higher ups ruled against it. their job is done, nothing more will be done about it. and the policy they are following is to be completly silent about he issue and never answer or react to anything about it. Never! \n\n\nThere is 2 possible solutions for this issue and I have no idea why Ea is not looking at implementing one of the both. \n\nObvious solution one is to revert the maximum buffer time allowed to resend data in case of error to the same amount to match the smoothness of an offline game and punish people with unfit connection to play online. Implement an in game logo to display in case the player connection is having packet drop issues and high jitter. Like the system they use in battlefield games.\n\nSolution 2 is to group players with bad internet together. let them play together, let the people playing on long distance wifi, unstable 3g/4g hotspots and overcrowded routers play against each other, so when there is lag compensation applied, they both suffer from the same effects instead of punishig people playing on proper connections. Pes have done this this year, allowing players to search for optimal connection and smooth gameplay, gave players the option to opt out of playing against wifi and 4g players... the technology is there and not really hard to implement, I have no idea why ea not looking in to this. \n\nThe community needs to stand together and demand a solution, the servers are fine, they even cut contracts with many old providers that had bad setups and connectiviry issues. the real problem is lag compensation, its need to abondonned (toned down) or give people the option to wait longer while searhing for games to play a smooth game! Lag compensation make the entire team a bunch of amateures with zero reaction and awarness, make the game engine stutters like hell in replays and post game cutscenes. It needs to stop!",

            "description": "**Prologue**\n\nI am a 35-year-old gamer. I’ve been lucky in being around long enough to have gone through many different eras in the world of computer games, and it has been an absolute blast.\n\nBut folks, there is a horrid disease running amok in the world of gaming. There was a time when gaming was an innocent past-time. Now, the industry is worth a whopping $107Billion worldwide, and climbing fast. There’s nothing innocent about it anymore. And obviously, EA want a piece of that juicy pie. Everything is now about greed. A company will do anything they can to get you hooked on their particular intellectual property. And with it, comes a very nasty surprise. Once hooked, your wallet becomes the sole target of these companies, taking whatever means necessary to get you to open it to them.\n\nIf you skim over this post, you’ll see that it is incredibly long. But that’s because it took this long to put into words everything that’s wrong with not only EA, but also this community. So, I hope you’ll join me in going through this post.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSimply put, EA are a publicly floated company partly owned by banks and major investment funds. They habitually and aggressively implement anti-consumer practices, while simultaneously shovelling out cynically produced titles whose only purpose is to make money at the expense of quality end-user experience. But then again, that can be said for any gaming company, right? Replace EA with Activision or Ubisoft and you get the same thing. But this post is all about our good friend EA. So, let’s crack on.\n\nThe subject of EA has been discussed and shouted about ad-nauseum. Personally, I simply roll my eyes any time I hear new information about how EA have once again shafted the gamers etc. Simply put, EA are a money grabbing monolith. Make no mistake about that. So how did EA get so big?\n\nMore importantly, the number 1 question to ask is:  \n\n**WHY DO EA TREAT YOU LIKE A LITTLE BITCH? – The answer is: BECAUSE YOU ARE ONE.**\n\nNow, before you reach for the down-vote button and walk away from this post for feeling angry and butthurt by that comment, please do read on. I will try to justify it.\n\nIt would be very easy to lay into EA for all the wrong things they’ve done. In fact, if I mention every single wrongdoing, this post would be 10 times as long. So, I will keep things in context.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Worst company in America 2012 – 2013**\n\nThe consumerist poll taken back in 2012 and 2013 put EA at the top of the tree in regards to being the worst company in America 2 years in a row. But are they really? There are many organisations worldwide that pile on the misery on their fellow human beings. Some are willing to kill for profit. BP, Exxon, Nestle, Monsanto, cigarette companies, all the banks, and so on. \n\nLet’s be honest here. EA may be an immoral money-making machine, but by no means are they making money from people’s deaths, or going out of their way to destroy the planet, or profiting from ecological disasters etc. You think EA are robbing you? How about we talk about the likes of Ticket Master or Verizon. By no means am I defending EA. Instead I’m trying to show the bigger picture in regards to the large number of unethical and immoral companies who operate and benefit at the expense of human misery worldwide.\n\nWhen you think about it, EA are simply just another company who were fortunate enough to have come up with an idea that no one else had thought of, albeit an unethical idea at that – and I’ll explain why shortly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**EA’s Obligations**\n\nLet’s get things absolutely straight here. EA only have obligations to 2 things. \n\n1. To their profit margins\n\n2. To their investors\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOutside of this, EA have absolutely no obligation to anything else whatsoever. That includes YOU. When you think about it, that’s just business as usual, albeit unethical. You have to be amoral (not immoral, although some companies choose this path too) in the world of business to survive. If you have morals, you won’t last a day in the high-flying world of dog-eat-dog capitalist society. EA will employ every known tactic in order to make you part ways with your money.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**r/FIFA in A Nutshell** \n\n*Disclaimer: I want to make it absolutely clear that there should be mutual respect between us all. And just as I have expressed my opinion freely, I accept your opinions openly. Therefore, everything I mention in this section in regards to us gamers, is simply said from the perspective of being constructive criticism. If it offends you, then with all due respect, the onus is on you to solve the issue constructively.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFolks, as much as we like to shit on EA for being a money hungry capitalist corporation (which they are), we are also to blame for the state of things as they stand.\n\nWant to know what’s more inconsistent than the horrendous inconsistency of this game? It’s the way us players see-saw between “fuck EA, I’ll never buy this game again!” to “Ooooh! New shiny packs!... WANT!” \n \nThink about it. We have absolutely no credibility left in us after 7 years of repeating the same process of coming on here moaning and whining about the game and its problems, yet before we even finish our sentence, we end up buying packs and getting hyped for the next set of shiny cards or the next iteration of the game. It speaks volumes about how fickle we are as gamers, which means any company can and will manipulate us at will.\n\nSeriously, grow a backbone and stick to your principles. Have a bit of control and self-respect in not opening your wallet so easily to the next set of shiny packs that are dangled in front of you. Give yourself the slight bit of dignity that you deserve and keep your money in your pocket.\n\nWe went from a whole 10 months of hating on EA for how bad FIFA 17 was, to instant hype prior to the release of FIFA 18. The voice of those who were cautious about the new game got drowned out by all the hype. Is it any wonder we get laughed at by other communities? We look dumb to the outside world. This community gets called toxic for a reason. We squabble amongst ourselves whilst EA gets richer at our expense. In case anyone forgot, the fat Ronaldo Super-Duper Deluxe Icon Edition 3000 cost up to £90 on release. Ask yourself. Was it worth it? And personally, I think those of us who romanticised the game pre-patch are simply in denial at having paid such a hefty sum for the game in the first place, and are trying to justify the cost.\n\nMost players have a defeatist attitude towards EA, not knowing that they have the power in their wallet. It’s been said many times: Vote with your wallet. How's #FixFIFA working out?...\n\nIt may not be easy to create a boycott, considering those who frequent Reddit are the minority, but at least do your bit. Just as it’s easy for you to spend £20 instantly on FIFA points, why not buy PES to give KONAMI a larger share? Let EA know where you stand as a disgruntled customer. But let’s admit it folks, we’re all addicted to the toxic nature of this game. That’s where the problem is.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Psychology of FIFA - Emotions**\n\nFolks, I’m no psychologist, but it’s easy to see that FIFA, NHL, Madden, NFS, NBA etc are all built around a certain set of psychological stepping stones – all geared to try and get a player to be heavily invested emotionally. I’ll try to point out something that doesn’t get discussed often, but that’s because it’s very subtle. \n\nMake no mistake about it folks, EVERYTHING that’s wrong with FIFA has a purpose. All the bugs, the glitches, the sudden passing that goes astray, the lack of control, or the horrendous moments of EAids encountered daily, which is littered across this sub in video form:- all these things happen for a reason: it’s purposefully incorporated into this horrid game to tilt the player, to PURPOSEFULLY frustrate you. Why you ask? Simple. Because an emotionally unstable player who has been left frustrated by faulty mechanics in a game will be more likely to open their wallet due to their inability to think rationally in that moment. Ask yourself. Have you ever played FIFA in the last 7 years without ever coming away frustrated? Most likely every session of FIFA has tilted you to some degree.\n\nIt’s been well documented that when emotions and tensions run high, a person is likely to have far higher level of flawed logic, and therefore may make rash decisions. In the case of this game, a person may think to themselves: “Aaaargh!! If only I had Messi and Ronaldo, I’d be winning these games with ease!!!…” and so, they end up opening their wallet for a chance to pack those players. \n\nFurthermore, if you’re the kind of player who gets totally frustrated after a session of FIFA to the point where you end up selling your multimillion coin team in a fit of rage, then you my friend, are the exact kind of player EA are targeting. Reason being that they know, we know, and most of all, YOU know that you’ll be back… After selling your team, maybe a day, or 2, or even a few weeks later, you’ll return to the game with fresh hope and a clear head. And so, with a newly established club, you go through the process all over again. And as we know with everything in regards to dynamic difficulty and slider manipulation, the game will start off essentially giving you free wins. Just enough to lure you in. Enough to caress your ego. And enough for you to be invested to the point of opening your wallet to EA once again. \n\n[HERE’S](https://streamable.com/npxxw) ex-EA CEO John Riccitiello speaking about how a player who is heavily invested in a game will be more willing to part with their money in order to continue their gaming experience. The premise is simple in regards to games containing microtransactions. Whatever game you are playing, the game rewards you left right and centre at the beginning to get you hooked. Suddenly halfway through the game, several hours in, just as you’re heavily invested, the rewards dry up, and the game introduces microtransactions in order to get the bigger, more powerful guns / powerups etc. without having to grind for them. AKA pay2win. These are abhorrent unethical tactics deployed by the gaming industry as a whole, but unfortunately gamers are none the wiser. \n\nAt every turn, EA are trying to manipulate us to open our wallets to them. They will nickel and dime us for all that we’re worth. All roads lead to buying FIFA Points. Even the way FIFA Points are set up is a psychological trick. Think about it. When you spend £79.99, you get 12,000 FP. This is an arbitrary number that no longer has the same connotation in comparison to having the price of a pack written in its true value underneath it, thereby removing the logic you might have if you initially saw the pack price before pulling the trigger. This sort of tactic is very effective on young children who do not know the true value of money. As an example, the lightning round packs go for 100,000 coins, or 2000 FP. In case you forgot, that’s £15 for a Bas Dost… \n\nEven when opening a pack, you have long been exposed to another psychological trick. You’ll notice that if a pack contains a [gold stripe](https://imgur.com/a/mODwo) in the animation phase, then you will have a board opening walkout, therefore a higher rated player (84+). I mention this because I’ve seen countless YouTube videos where the OP instantly skips the pack if it doesn’t contain the gold stripe. Think about how this influences the young demographic watching their video. It is creating a feedback loop. One that only benefits EA.\n\nEA must be so thankful that the majority of us are so keen to open our wallets so easily at the drop of a hat, or in the case of FIFA, at the drop of new shiny cards on a weekly basis. Since when is spending £79.99 on FIFA Points considered a “micro” transaction? That’s what you would call a major transaction! Remind me again why I shouldn’t call you EA’s little bitch, when you’re willing to open your wallet to them so easily.\n\nOn top of that, whether you realise it or not, EA are mocking us. For the last few iterations of FUT, the [FIFA Points button](https://imgur.com/a/1KYVK) within FUT is a picture of a goalkeeper diving towards the FIFA Points icon. EA know they have us by the balls, and are shamelessly taunting us. Yet we’re too addicted to break the cycle. That’s our fault. We have no one to blame but ourselves. \n\nBut then again, EA are feeding on our emotions as mentioned earlier. From the avid Real Madrid fan who swears death on their Barcelona rival, to the old man who turns up and stands on the by-line to watch his non-league team play in the pouring rain, we all love football. We turn to football as a form of escape. EA don’t see the beautiful game in the same way as we do. They see it as a money grab. These two different viewpoints do not bode well together. They collide badly.\n\nEA have bought out all the licences, have jazzed up their game to look as realistic as possible, yet the game plays anything but realistic or beautiful. It is solely built for instant gratification. There are many players who have quickly accustomed themselves to the mechanics of the game and even go as far as playing the toxic Weekend League consisting of 40 games packed in a 3-day cycle, all for the sake of getting the shiny cards. As long as people play the game, EA will continue to profit. It is up to you on whether you want to continue down this path, or to free yourself from the misery of the perpetual cycle of stress and pure frustration that this game dishes out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Ugly Side of Gambling & Addiction**\n\nGambling within gaming is a grey area. As soon as it gets discussed, people come to its defence by saying “you get what you pay for” – That may be very partially true, but the downsides to it are far greater. People who are too young are ending up getting addicted to the nature of opening loot boxes. FIFA is rated ESRB 3+ yet contains predatory gambling mechanics. By buying the game, we are accepting these gambling mechanics as the norm.\n\nIn FIFA, the razzmatazz and fireworks when packing a high rated player are greater in presentation than the celebration and ticker tape shown for winning a hard-fought online season on FUT. Where do you think EA’s priorities lie?... \n\nThink about it. If I buy a lottery ticket in the UK, I am actively choosing to part with my £2 for a chance of winning £millions. More importantly, I KNOW precisely what my odds are. The chances of winning the lottery in the UK is set at approximately 1 in 14 million. Now that may be a veeeeeeeeeeeery minimal chance, but hey, at least I KNOW the odds, right? Ask yourself, do you know the odds of packing Messi or Ronaldo?? The answer is NO, yet most of us keep opening our wallets and pumping money into this shitpit. Is that not what addiction is? \n\nEA must be laughing their ass off at us. We are seen as morons. Why then should they listen to any complaint we may have about the game when we have absolutely no credibility left? We are all essentially barrel-scraping addicts. I truly hope you can all see the major problem we have here.\n\nWhen you think about it, every post on this forum complaining about the game is actually a cry for help by the addicted masses.\n\nMeanwhile [WHALES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_roller) like [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/74b6co/hi_im_jamie_and_i_am_a_pack_addict/) individual went and spent £1000 due to their addiction, and the best card he could shout about was Chiellini. That’s absolutely insane, but this sort of spending has now become the norm. Just look at all the Youtubers who get sponsored to open packs and shout and scream in a fake manner in order to hype their 12-year-old subscribers, who then try to emulate their YouTube heroes with their parents’ credit card [unbeknown to the parent](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/7jze2v/boy_spends_his_mothers_entire_months_wages_in/). Take a look at the responses in that post above to see the cognitive dissonance and denial in full effect. Sickening.\n\nBut in the end, the onus is on us. The gaming industry is now all about predatory gambling mechanics and opportunities. Every company is at it. It’s up to us to be aware of the pitfalls. But we are alone in this. For example, in the UK, anything that is aired on TV needs to be accepted through OFCOM prior to broadcast. OFCOM are essentially the governing body who control what can be shown on TV. We have no such protection in the gaming industry, and most publishers and developers are pushing forward with unethical tactics and predatory gambling methods. \n\nHeck, even China, a country that is not exactly well known for its human rights record seems to have a better handle on gaming by requesting that all companies that participate in their market to show odds of loot boxes etc. It’s why EA won’t release FIFA over there, as they would have to show the odds. \n\nMaybe through FOI (Freedom of Information Request) we can get more information about the pack weights and such. As gamers, we simply don’t get told what rights we have.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Hidden Mechanics**\n\nRemember [Slider Manipulation](http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/5kxryd/lets_discuss_sliders/) from last year? Back then it was just a theory, without much proof. Well how about this year? A quick look at all [THESE](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/search?q=sliders&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&t=year) examples should tell you that sliders are a thing. It is the basis for all the bullshit in this game. All the inconsistencies, every instance of horrid EAids seen on Squad Battles and Weekend League can now be attributed to the sliders changing as well as the RNG being set high. We need to call it Slider Manipulation. Don’t call it scripting. That word confuses people and derails any discussion about it.\n\n[HERE's](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/6k7dsq/for_those_of_you_who_are_confused_by_the_vision/) a video showing how the supposed Vision stat works. After watching this video, it’s clear to see that there’s quite a bit of coding going on behind the scenes at every step. But have you considered the fact that even though Fabregas has greater vision than the other midfielder, all it takes is a slider to reduce his vision in-game on the fly for the pass to go astray? That’s exactly what happens at certain moments with the different stats in matches, therefore making this game a nightmare to play due to its inconsistencies.\n\nThe Halloween cards are something else that needs to be mentioned in the same regard. How were EA able to increase the base stats on Halloween cards during the period that they went up in stats? They injected code into the game via server-side coding. After the period, the cards returned to normal ratings. Why isn’t anyone questioning how this was done without any patches being downloaded? Imagine what EA can do in terms of server-side manipulation of stats. Especially hidden stats that we know nothing about. I suggest folks research into SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) EA can see everything going on at any given time. The number of simultaneous games, goals scored, money spent, hidden stats changed etc.\n\nAI programming in gaming is most likely a nightmare. I won’t take anything away from the developers. But developers lack the ability to program true AI. So instead, the lazy route is taken. In the case of FIFA, players stats are maxed out to 99 in Squad Battles on Ultimate difficulty. Think of how pointless this makes the game. For example, imagine if you have been grinding and spending so much money and time in order to acquire Ronaldo, and you finally have him in your squad, only to end up watching him get chased down by a 54-rated bronze player on Squad Battles who has been juiced up. That should never ever happen. It renders having Ronaldo as useless. \n\nThe same form of buffed up AI exists in other games. For example, Forza 7’s \"Unbeatable\" difficulty level is the same as Ultimate difficulty on FIFA. The AI cars get buffed up [beyond their overall maximum horsepower](https://www.reddit.com/r/forza/comments/76m365/how_the_game_cheats_on_unbeatable/) that a car can technically have. This seems to be the new trend with programming, and unfortunately, it’s ruining gaming.\n\nGames such as FIFA, NHL, Madden, NBA2K etc are all part of what’s called [Shovelware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shovelware). These games are recycled on a yearly basis, with a small update, new skins and rosters etc, and a hefty price tag is slapped on and sold as a brand-new game. The marketing teams then step in to hype the masses, and it’s smooth sailing from there. We really do get manipulated far too easily unfortunately. And as things stand with the game currently, we can all agree that it is in an atrocious state. But EA are about to make a killing from profiting further from sales. It’s Christmas, and all the parents will be buying this game for their children as a present. Then come January, the game will most likely receive a further patch to streamline the game even further for the casuals. Then there’s all the TOTY, TOTS cards being released etc. Prepare for the hype. Things are going to get worse before they get any better.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Future**\n\nAs a community, we are disjointed and broken. We have one or two of us, who are truly helpful individuals, who go out of their way to help others. We have a larger number of individuals who simply play the game regardless of the issues. We have the majority who use the sub for making complaints about issues with the game (understandably). And finally, we have those of us who are considered as ‘shills’ or griefers who supposedly come to the defence of EA as well as troll in posts with the “git gud” comments etc. The point I’m trying to make is that we are not a force overall. If you look at other subs, there’s a greater discord amongst gamers. See r/Battlefront or r/Forza, or any other gaming subs for examples of a better organised community.\n\nWhen Forza 7 was released, as per the unethical money-making schemes that EA has deployed throughout the years, Microsoft tried to get in on the action this year. The Ultimate Edition of Forza 7 is similar to FIFA 18’s Icon edition, costing an eye-watering £90 on release. Those who bought Forza 7 were left with a bad taste in their mouth due to the limitations that Turn 10 and Microsoft had placed on the player base. For example, the game only allowed players to earn double XP for the first 25 races of career mode instead of throughout the lifecycle of the game like the previous versions. Understandably, this angered the community. It was a slap in the face of those who were loyal to the franchise, having spent such a hefty sum of money. \n\nBut the difference is there to be seen. The community made their feelings known and made enough noise in order for Microsoft and Turn 10 to take notice and revert the changes. One of the reasons this was able to occur is because of the demographic that plays Forza compared to FIFA. Forza has an older, more mature demographic than FIFA. As a result, the community took a strict stance against Microsoft. The news quickly spread to outside sources. And as we all know; bad publicity can quickly ruin a company. And so, changes were made in an instant patch that rewarded gamers better. \n\nThere are many other similar examples, such as how Square Enix royally screwed Eidos and the players when it came to Deus Ex. At the last minute, unbeknownst to the developers and gamers, Square Enix had introduced microtransactions to the game. And while it wasn’t mandatory, it did enough damage for the game to fail in being sold well. As a result, the Deus Ex franchise is now shelved without the final chapter to be released any time soon. \n\nWant more examples? Take Two decided to stop gamers from being able to mod GTA V on the PC, which was the sole reason players bought the game on the PC in the first place. The player base retaliated by giving the game negative reviews on Steam, lowering the game’s overall rating and giving the publisher a bad reputation. \n\nWhen Hello Games initially released No Man’s Sky, it was seen as a cash grab. The game was essentially only 50% of what was shown at E3. Understandably, gamers let their feelings be known through negative feedback on Steam, thereby lowering the rating of the game. It got to the point where Hello Games were being investigated for false advertisement here in the UK. However, credit where credit is due, Hello Games stuck at it and have managed to incorporate many of the features initially shown, albeit 2 years later.\n\nEA were responsible for changing Battlefield 1 in a similar way. Prior to the release of the game, EA touted Battlefield 1 as a proper shooter, where no loot boxes existed. This excited the gaming community. Finally, they could play a game that was solely about skill, where ranking up required true investment of time and skill. Once the game was released, the reviews catapulted the game to the top of the charts as a classic shooter. Everyone was happy. But this is EA we’re talking about. And true to form, once the dust had settled and all the reviews had come in, EA executed their usual switch and bait tactic, and introduced loot boxes into the game, thereby making the game pay2win. The community were enraged. But nothing could be done by that point. \n\nNeed I say anything about [Battlefront 2?](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/)...\n\nThere are many other examples of gamers getting shafted. But the point remains. We as gamers, are getting nickel and dimed at every turn. We’re seen as idiots by these companies. Isn’t it time we changed things?...\n\nIf you want to play wholesome entertaining games that provide pure unadulterated joy, there are many out there without all the bullshit. Take the Nintendo Switch line-up of Zelda, Mario Odyssey, and Mario Kart as an example. Or Horizon Dawn. And the exceptional Witcher 3 by CD Projekt Red. \n\nWant to know why some games are amazing while others are cash-cows? It’s to do with the passion that the company has for making the game in the first place. For example, The Witcher 3 is an outstanding game with incredible longevity, and free DLC to boot. It’s a game created by gamers, for gamers. Imagine that… a company that actually cares about their game. Sounds a lot more attractive than working for a coding department in a large company like EA, who are hell bent on increasing their quarterly profit, doesn’t it?...\n\nThe developers at EA simply do enough to have a semi working game, while hanging on to their jobs in order to take a pay packet home to their families. That’s the difference. This was portrayed in a recent post by an EA developer. People may have mocked his response and subsequently created the “actionable feedback” meme as a result, but everyone seems to have missed the subtle message that maybe, just maybe, the developer in question didn’t have much passion for his job and didn't give a shit. Who can blame him.\n\nNintendo on the other hand, have a different philosophy altogether. As a Japanese company, they try to remain loyal to their customers by releasing a fully working package without trying to nickel and dime their customers in comparison to most Western hemisphere companies, who are hell bent on making profit.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Final Thought**\n\nAnd so, for the 7th year in a row, the same vicious cycle repeats itself. Hype and excitement turned to anger and rage. Once again EA have shafted everyone. Releasing a completely different game compared to what was showcased in the demo and the beta. Are you surprised? The same exact sequence of events has occurred in the last 6 iterations of the game, but we obviously didn’t learn our lesson. \n\nThis is absolute insanity on our part. After all, insanity is defined as: \n**Doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different outcomes.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Edit:**\nGood God. This blew up. Thank you all for the gold. I truly appreciate it, I'm humbled, thank you. \n\nWe've been plagued by the abhorrent problems year on year. It is up to us whether to put up with it all and carry on, or walk away from it once and for all and swap it with a far more rewarding game. \n\nLastly I'd like to wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy new year",

It’s one of the biggest complaints  about the game at the moment,\n\n2. It’s so easy to fix. The technology is there. EA can already extend the WL if there has been a major issue. \n\nWe don’t need Youtubers, some will join some won’t, but if this sub needs to make a stand and spreads the word to the EA forums and Youtubers, EA will sit up and listen (look at Chemgate). Remember we as a collective have the power to decide whether EA gets its money or not. Plus let’s be real you’ll just end up pulling Nani, Sule or Gamerio anyway. \n\nTLDR: A boycott of black friday is quite a simple approach: simply don't purchase any fifa points during the black friday promos, spread the word. \n\n\nEdit: Wow this has got some attention. I just want to say that I totally agree that gameplay needs to be fixed as well. \n\nThe reason I mentioned WL, was it’s a pretty easy fix, whereas gameplay could take them weeks or months to fix. Also they could make the WL inclusive so everyone gets a shot. \n\nHowever, make no bones about it, the gameplay is currently embarrassing considering how much money they make compared to PES. ",

After listing 17 bugs that a majority have been voiced since Fifa 18, EA scolded the thread after we attempted to keep the thread alive. The thread was filled with bug reports and criticism at both the false advertised product and disrespect to the Career Mode community. After I reported 9 new major bugs that are causing the game mode to be unplayable, EA shut down the thread. We are hours from official release and they are attempting to hide the fact that they’re selling a broken game. We ask that you join us on our pinned post and voice with us against EA’s attempt to cover up this extreme issue. Thank you!\n\n❗️Update: EA is deleting comments on the forum that allow users to know Sony is providing refunds.\n\nMake #fixcareermode trend on Twitter. Keep the pressure on EA. They’re refusing to acknowledge that they sold a broken product.\n\nUpdate 2: EA has said the patch to address prioritized bugs will not be included in the first patch\n\nhttps://twitter.com/eacoreysa/status/1177616040739536897?s=21\n\n\nNew EA forum thread:\nhttps://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/Career-Mode-Issues-Megathread/td-p/8244343",

            "description": "This is a serious post, and a seriously long post. The leading cause of death in 15-35 year old men is suicide, and 15-35 year old men is pretty much the target demographic of FUT. \n\nI've had a couple of close friends face some really challenging times  in the last year, and count myself lucky that they have opened up and talked to myself and others before it's too late. A lot of people aren't that lucky.\n\nSo you are probably wondering how this relates to FIFA. I guess I'm sort of asking a favour, of as many people as possible....\n\nFIFA is a game, people play it to relax and unwind, people play it because it's fun, people play it because it's something they are good at when they feel like they are shit at other things in life. We all know how good it can make us feel when things are going our way, when we win a few games, when we pack a great player. For a lot of people, when they've had a bad day they can turn to FIFA and know it's something that can cheer them up or make them feel better.\n\nWhat I'm trying to illustrate is that the person on the other side of that screen could be going through a really shitty time, that can be someone who just lost a relative, just found out they have cancer, just failed college, just lost their job. \n\nThere seems to be an increasing trend, on this forum and in the game itself, to be shitty towards people- to wind people up, to try and sap the joy out of other people's playing experience as much as possible, and to try to make them feel as shitty as possible in the process of playing a video game which should be a positive experience. \n\nI look back at some of my comments on this subreddit and to an extent I'm guilty of that as well - if someone posts showing off their squad I'm the first to tell them that it belongs in the squad thread, or to call them out when they are clearly flexing but trying to disguise it as a question about the game or their squad. I forget that for some people on here, they might not have friends in real life to share this with, and affirmation from strangers on Reddit could actually bring some positivity to their day, it takes less than half a second for me to scroll past if I'm not interested, or drop a positive comment or suggestion about their squad in the thread, so going forward that's what I'll do. To anyone that applies to on here - I'm sorry for being a bit of a dick.\n\nWhen it comes to the game itself, we know what triggers us, and we know what triggers other people - whether that is watching all the replays and celebrating extensively, using all the pauses at the end of a game, quitting when you're drawing with someone but you know they are going to win, sending shitty messages after a game... There are a lot of shitty things that EA let you do, personally I'm not too bothered by any of these, but the demographic that play FIFA are the most vulnerable from a mental health perspective, and so the most likely to be affected by these negative behaviours.\n\nI get pissed off when I think about someone behaving like that towards someone I care about - my brother in law who's getting bullied, my friend who just lost his brother in a car crash earlier this year. Is there a reason to be toxic and negative towards these people you don't know? \n\nWhat I'm asking of everyone is just to **be a bit kinder**.That's it. On here, in the game, in real life. It literally costs you nothing not to be a dick. Instead of sending shitty messages when you lose, try sending positive or encouraging messages when you win, skip your replays and celebrations, don't quit out on someone in a penalty shootout just because you know you're about to lose. \n\nI'd also urge EA to actually consider the mental health of their players in the way they design their game - find me another game where your opponent can force you to watch their celebrations and replays for 3-4 whole minutes of your life each game, or a game where you have to play up to 10hrs per weekend to remain \"competitive\", the game should promote sportsmanship - give XP or coins for skipping replays etc, the game should promote a healthy and balanced lifestyle - give people bonus xp if they hit  10,000 steps in a day or go to the gym, or do something that gets them away from the screen.\n\n**Tl:Dr;** the demographic that play FIFA are the most vulnerable from a mental health perspective. You don't know how shitty a day the other person has had, so just be kind to them for fucks sake.\n\nLastly, I would urge anyone who feels like they are struggling to reach out and talk to someone, a friend, a family member, or  if it's easier to talk to a complete stranger - the Samaritans offer a fantastic service in the UK where you can talk in confidence to a complete stranger about anything that's getting you down. They do a fantastic job and have helped somebody very close to me this year, for which I am really thankful.\n\nwww.samaritans.org\n\nEdit: posted this before I went to the beach today, expected it to get a couple of upvotes and die in new but I'm genuinely appreciative of the time people have taken to read this and get involved in the conversation! Thank you so much for the awards and positive messages, I'll do my best to get involved in the comments but there is an awful lot to read through.",

That's it. That's the only interaction you can influence (aside from the game itself). It has been established time after time that replays of goals and all these cutscenes do not improve gameplay (lol they even added a new one where you zoom in on the player who scored and he does this stupid fistpump thing to his teammate). You can either be pissed and buy a pack for unreal amounts of money in a hope of packing something which has 1% or you can flame your opponent afterwards after he showed you a bunch of sad replays/celebrations.\n\nThis game is not about fun interaction.

            "description": " \n\nHello!\n\nI’m back again this year with another guide on dribbling. While left stick dribbling has been taken into an dark alley, never to be seen again, dribbling is far from dead. It’s a bit harder but still very effective.\n\nI’ve been a bit weary on doing these guides as it’ll be similar to last years guides, but as it’s been asked for, I figured why not. I’ve added some tips, changed some based on how FIFA 23 plays, and some are the same from last year.\n\nI do have a few guides planned that I didn’t do last year so they’ll be up eventually, but if there’s interest, I could redo the ones about passing/defending and adapt them to FIFA 23. With that in mind, lets begin. Keep in mind that many of these are usable together.\n\n**First touch control (command: L1/LB)**\n\nThis still works, using L1/LB as you receive the ball will position your player closer to it and makes the next command be executed faster. This is especially effective in tight situations such as in and around your opponents box.\n\n[Side to side comparison.](https://streamable.com/c663u3)\n\n**Strafe & Agile dribbling (L1/LB – Strafe, R1/RB – Agile)**\n\nStrafe dribbling – Emphasis on the ball and keeping it close.\n\nAgile Dribbling – Emphasis on the body and agile movements.\n\n[Demonstration](https://streamable.com/qdg9m7)\n\nThis year is all about strafe and agile dribbling. The biggest difference from last year is that you shouldn’t be holding it in, slight taps when changing directions feel smother then left-stick dribbling and makes it easier to get around your opponent.\n\nWhile this might depend on person to person, personally I’ve felt that strafe dribbling is effective in straight directions ([Like this](https://imgur.com/a/Wsc0Byf)), where as agile is better in diagonal directions ([like this](https://imgur.com/a/MoEvqj6)). If you’re not familiar or comfortable with these commands and want to learn, I’d say that Strafe dribbling suits non-skillers, and agile dribbling suits skillers.\n\n[Strafe example](https://streamable.com/1hu3jn)\n\n[Agile example](https://streamable.com/rlbui9)\n\n**First touch into space or backwards**.\n\nYour first touch is what determines what you can do after you’ve received the ball. It sets you up for any following decision. You should ALWAYS look to take your first touch into space if. Any time you move into space where there’s a defender, you’re giving the defender a chance to challenge and win the ball. Taking it into space removes that option entirely. If you want to challenge a defender, never do it with your first touch, especially with how inconsistent FIFA is with touches.\n\n[Touch into space examples](https://streamable.com/im77hu)\n\nNow sometimes there not much space for you to move into, an easy solution is to move backwards. This gives you time to see what happens and react to it.\n\n[Touch backwards](https://streamable.com/cy5dmi)\n\nAnd if you’re completely surrounded then your best option is a first time pass back to the player that had it.\n\n**Change of pace**\n\nSame as last year, the L1/LB into R2/RT gives an unexpected burst of space that can get you past your opponent and open up space for a shot or pass. This is mostly effective when you want to get a shot off as pace in general has been nerfed this year.\n\n[Examples](https://streamable.com/xo4t27)\n\nNow this works both ways, changes of pace but going from fast to slow can also confuse the defender and make him run past. Easiest way to get it done is to move up normally without any movement inputs, and if the defender is coming with speed you press L1/LB to slow down and have him run past.\n\n[Example](https://streamable.com/9in79n)\n\n**Angles, pace and direction**\n\nWith the hype around lengthy, you can use it to your advantage if a defender is coming from a distance. Also is he sprinting or jockeying? Taking into account what movements are natural for a defender helps in getting around them. Combining this with changes of pace makes you hard to read and defend against.\n\n[Example.](https://streamable.com/s2xgh7)\n\n**Herrera spin**\n\nI absolutely love this, and they’ve made it even easier this year. If there’s any tip I can recommend to put into your play it’s this one. The simple movement is almost always enough to fool the defender. While I primarily use it around the box, it can be used anywhere to relieve pressure.\n\nThere’s 2 ways to do it. The first way to do it is pressing L1/LB + R1/RB + moving the left stick in the direction the ball is coming from.The second one requires no inputs, just left-stick movement. Emphasis on the circular motion.\n\n[Examples](https://streamable.com/ebu0sq)\n\n**Ball roll**\n\nUseful in many situations, i primarily use it in 1v1 against the GK and to open up space for a pass/shot.\n\n[Example 1](https://streamable.com/jd4vid) \\- Open space\n\n[Example 2](https://streamable.com/zg94iq)\\- Get around the GK, notice how i take a touch backwards to open space and see what he does.\n\n**Patience is key**\n\nIf you’re in a situations where you’ve outnumbered your opponent, or he’s simply not applying any pressure to the ball holder, be patient. Take your time and move up. \n\n[examples](https://streamable.com/cuhyhb)\n\nIn the first example he’s looked between either cutting the lane or blocking the shot. In the second one,beeing patient lets me decide after he’s opened up one option. there’s no need for me to do anything other than move up, the pressure is completely on him to do something.\n\n**General**\n\nDribbling is all about reading and outplaying your opponent, especially in how you take advantage of open space. I believe that being able to switch up from dribbling and passing makes you very hard to defend against. Dribbling specifically can be done in many different ways, the most important thing is that you’re going for a style that suits you. \n\nI hope this is helpful to anyone, and feel free to ask any questions!",

            "description": "So I was at a family friends house for a small party like get together. They have an Autistic son who just got FIFA so I was helping him set up his Ultimate Team. Did a few SBC's, gathered around 10k and bought him the Anus Destroying Duo of Musa and Rashford, along with a cheap BPL team behind them. \n\nHe started going into Division 10 games and really wasnt that good. He lost his first two but scored in both. The third game he comes up against the best a team in D10 can get. Reus, Aubameyang, and OTW Dembele started upfront for him. It was a death sentence. \n\nHe started off the game by talking shit right off the bat. The man went 1-0 up quickly, and immediately ran to midfield and shush dabbed the shit out of my family friends kid. The kid was also talking through the TV from his mic. Literally flipping out calling my friend shit at the game and the usual FIFA toxicity. He scores again and this time goes ham. He's screaming through his mic, calling my family friends son a pussy and a retard, which was not appropriate for the situation obviously. He got really upset, and started freaking out because he was literally called retarded and was getting abused.\n\nLittle did the dabbing idiot know, homeboy over here finished Elite in Weekend League. I told my family friends son to give me the controller. I looked my arch nemesis Ahmed Musa in the eyes, we both know that our rivalry cannot continue. We must destroy this imbecile. The kid was still talking as I kicked off. I felt the AIDs on my side. \n\nI have never played so hard in my life. The kid was hopeless. I smashed 7 goals by him before he finally rage quit. It felt so good to not only dab after every goal, but to avenge my family friends kid who was visibly upset. I'm so happy that I got to beat that cunt. I reported him to Xbox as well although that won't do anything. \n\nIf you somehow see this person who upset my family friends autistic son, git gud.",

One of my favourite Dutch FIFA YouTubers, FCRoelie, suggested this and I found it a real good sollution for division droppers in rivals. Why cant EA make the challenge so that you need to earn rivals points with 1st owner teams? For example earn 3000 rivals points with 11 Bundesliga starters. \n\nThis way you dont need wins to complete this challenge and it will roughly take the same amount of time. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nEdit: formatting",

Had the packs been tradeable I could argue with the price but damn the sheer corruption and greed in the company is INSANE.\n\nAnd I agree that this 100% has something to do with FUT Economist being hired, he's silent as fuck and he knows how the game is played from the inside out.

            "description": "# Summary\n\nThis is a guide on how I earn Elite 1 in Weekend League more often than not. **No, this is not a Drop Back meta-slave setup.** This is a **VERY lengthy guide** in which I will cover player types to use, instructions, and tactics. I spent some good time working on this, so if there is anything I did not cover, please feel free to ask me below! Cheers!\n\nEDIT: To those of you who keep saying things to the effect of “im losing to 4231 and 442 using this formation. how is this possible if my 352 is supposed to counter it?” just because the formation is designed to counter, doesn’t mean that you automatically win. your opponent just may be better than you...\n\nEDIT: since it’s been asked a lot, my camera angle is co-op\n\nEDIT: i didn’t include anything about chemistry styles because you can figure that out for yourself. look at what your player choices lack and apply the chemistry style to boost them. your attackers likely need pace/shooting/dribbling boosts. your wide mids likely need pace/passing/defending boosts. your cdms likely need pace/defending boosts. \n\nEDIT: A lot of you have asked for gameplay videos. I don't have any. I jsut created this short little clip to show how you can easily beat 1 depth drop back. \nhttps://streamable.com/xtit0t\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYa'll probably want to see my squads early on, so I'm just going to link all of them here.\n\n* All Squads At Various Points of the Game (all start in other formations for chem purposes)\n   * [Future (Hopefully, when Bundesliga Tots comes out)](https://www.futbin.com/custom-squad-builder/view/64645)\n   * [Current](https://www.futbin.com/20/squad-builder/view/15861015)\n   * [Pre-PL Tots Sale](https://www.futbin.com/20/squad-builder/view/15860942)\n   * [Early December](https://www.futbin.com/20/squad-builder/view/15860814) with the caveat that RTTF Partey was only an 84 (or 86, I can't remember) at the time.\n   * [First Squad](https://www.futbin.com/20/squad-builder/view/15860651)\n\n# Now, sit back, relax, and [lemme tell you somethin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Wof8Stc7Q)\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n1. Why I like the 352 over the 442 and 4231.\n2. Instructions for each position\n3. Custom tactics and why you need at least 3 different setups\n4. Player Archetypes for each position in my 352\n5. Substitution Philosophy\n6. My play style\n7. Tips for making the change to the 352\n\n# 1. Why I Like the 352 Over the 442 and 4231.\n\nLooking at the player-to-player lineup of the 352, it is a direct counter (in my opinion anyway) to both the 4231 and 442. The Left and Right Mids in the 352 can man mark the LCAM and RCAM in the 4231. The two CDMs can man mark the CCAM and the Striker. And if that fails, I have 3 CBs that can clean up anything that gets through. **The 4231 is formationally countered.** The Left and Right Mids in the 352 can man mark the LM and RM in the 442. The two CDMs can man mark the opponent's two CMs. My 3 CBs can clean up and man mark the 2 strikers. **The 442 is formationally countered.**\n\nGoing on the attack, the 352 is overwhelming without leaving you caught out. This will be covered more in the **My Play Style** section.\n\n# 2. Instructions for Each Position\n\nSome of the positions below will have more than one set of instructions. This will make more sense when we get to the Custom Tactics section.\n\n**Goalkeeper**: Yes, you need to put some instructions on your keeper\n\n* Saving on Crosses -- **Comes for Crosses**\n* Saving Outside Box -- **Sweeper Keeper**\n\n**Centerbacks:** Don't touch anything.\n\n* Attacking Support -- **Stay Back While Attacking**\n* Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions** (You can choose **Aggressive Interceptions** here, but be warned: your defenders will tire faster and - if they aren't the top of the top tier - will make some great interceptions but can get caught out of position more easily. **Do not use Conservative Interceptions or Neymar et.al. will have a laugh at you as they prance around your back line.)**\n\n**Center Defensive Midfielders:** Depending on your ability to defend well manually with your CBs, you can be more or less aggressive here. Be honest with yourself and your abilities. You will/may need 3 different sets of instructions here.\n\n* Setup 1 -- Both CDMs have identical instructions. If you are an average manual defender or find yourself allowing your opponent to play in behind easily, this is for you\n   * Defensive Behavior -- **Cut Passing Lanes**\n   * Attacking Support -- **Stay Back While Attacking**\n   * Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions**\n   * Defensive Position -- **Cover Center**\n* Setup 2 -- One True CDM and One Box-To-Box\n   * LCDM (or RCDM. Just pick one)\n      * Defensive Behavior -- **Cut Passing Lanes**\n      * Attacking Support -- **Stay Back While Attacking**\n      * Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions**\n      * Defensive Position -- **Cover Center**\n   * RCDM (Or LCDM, whichever one you didn't pick)\n      * Defensive Behavior -- **Man Mark**\n      * Attacking Support -- **Balanced Attack**\n      * Interceptions -- **Aggressive Interceptions**\n      * Defensive Position -- **Cover Center**\n* Setup 3 -- Two Box-To-Box midfielders have identical instructions. (Depending on the stamina of your CDMs, playing with this set of instructions all game will require midfield subs.)\n   * Defensive Behavior -- **Man Mark**\n   * Attacking Support -- **Balanced Attack**\n   * Interceptions -- **Aggressive Interceptions**\n   * Defensive Position -- **Cover Center**\n\n**Wide Midfielders:** These players are the workhorses of your squad. They won't score often and they won't register many assists, but if you skimp on these positions, you will get exploited. Your wide mids need to be able to defend. No, they don't need to body players like VVD, but they do need to do the job well. Outside of that, you can choose to go the pacey route or the technical route (more on what I mean here in the Player Archetypes section).\n\n* Setup 1 -- Pacey. If you're not great at skill moves and manual defending, then this is the option for you. Be honest with yourself and your skills.\n   * Defensive Support -- **Come Back On Defense**\n   * Chance Creation -- **Balanced Width** or **Free Roam** (Different players have different natural off the ball movements. I prefer Balanced on some players and Free Roam on others)\n   * Support Runs -- **Get In Behind**\n   * Support on Crosses -- **Stay On Edge Of Box For Cross** (But u/wahoos22 why wouldn't you want to get into the box with a pacey winger??? Because the game is weird and the Stay on Edge instruction helps to stop your players from over-running passes)\n   * Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions**\n* Setup 2 -- Technical. If you are good at LS dribbling, L1/LB dribbling, and picking out key passes, this is an option for you.\n   * Defensive Support -- **Come Back On Defense**\n   * Chance Creation -- **Stay Wide**\n   * Support Runs -- **Come Short**\n   * Support on Crosses -- **Stay On Edge Of Box For Cross**\n   * Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions**\n\n**Central Attacking Midfielder:** It may sound strange, but this is your best player. He will not only score the most goals, but will have the most assists. (But u/wahoos22, that doesn't make any sense! Your CAM should be the creator for the strikers!?!? Normally you'd be right. More on why in the My Play Style section).\n\n* Defensive Support -- **Stay Forward**\n* Support On Crosses -- **Stay On Edge Of Box For Cross**\n* Positioning Freedom -- **Free Roam** or **Stick To Position** (Just don't use Drift Wide. It's trash for your CAM)\n* Interceptions -- **Conservative Interceptions** or \\*\\*Normal Interceptions (\\*\\*Lower stam players will not tire as quickly with Conservative instructions).\n\n**Strikers:** Again, it may sound strange, but these players are more creators than goal scorers (but having absolute rockets of shots here doesn't hurt!)\n\n* Left Striker -- Your playmaker.\n   * Support Runs -- **Stay Central**\n   * Attacking Runs -- **Mixed Attack**\n   * Interceptions -- **Conservative Interceptions** or **Normal Interceptions**\n   * Defensive Support -- **Stay Forward**\n* Right Striker -- Your space creator.\n   * Support Runs -- **Drift Wide**\n   * Attacking Runs -- **Get In Behind**\n   * Interceptions -- **Conservative Interceptions** or **Normal Interceptions**\n   * Defensive Support -- **Stay Forward**\n\n# 3. Custom Tactics and Why You Need at Least 3 (4) Setups\n\nSo you've made it through the instructions and want to know the tactics. Great! Thanks for reading this far.\n\nThis play style requires 3 (4) different setups. A standard play setup, a come from behind setup, a hold on for the win setup, and a my-352-isn't-working-this-game setup (yes it will happen. sometimes you just need some variety to break down a very strong defensive opponent).\n\n**Standard Play:** Use this when the game is tied, or you are up/down by only 1 goal. Basically, use this when it's a close match.\n\n* Defensive Style -- **Balance**\n* Width -- **3 out of 10**\n* Depth -- **4/5 out of 10** (I have been flipping back and forth between the two for as long as it has been an option. I just can't decide which I prefer)\n* Offensive Style -- **Fast Build Up** or **Long Ball** (If you're going to use long ball, make sure you have an outlet to bang it up the pitch to. That means, you need a tall striker who is good in the air, pacey wide mids, or both.)\n* Width -- **7 out of 10**\n* Players In Box -- **6/7 out of 10** (This will vary based on the natural off the ball movement of your players. Test it out for yourself)\n* Corners -- **1 out of 5**\n* Free Kicks -- **1 out of 5**\n\n**Come From Behind:** Use this when you are down late and need a quick comeback. Don't abuse it or use it for extended periods of play as it will absolutely kill your entire team's stamina.\n\n* Defensive Style -- **Constant Pressure**\n* Width -- **5 out of 10**\n* Depth -- **9 out of 10** (10 out of 10 just feels glitched for some reason)\n* Offensive Style -- **Fast Build Up** or **Long Ball** (If you're going to use long ball, make sure you have an outlet to bang it up the pitch to. That means, you need a tall striker who is good in the air, pacey wide mids, or both.)\n* Width -- **7 out of 10**\n* Players In Box -- **10 out of 10**\n* Corners -- **5 out of 5**\n* Free Kicks -- **5 out of 5**\n\n**Hold The Lead:** Use this when you are up late and need to hold on. Don't abuse it or use it for extended periods of play as DDA will kick in and you will concede.\n\n* Defensive Style -- **Drop Back** (But u/wahoos22, you said it wasn't gonna be a drop back meta??? It's not. This is a legitimate strategy that should be employed for the last 10 minutes or so of any match you are winning.)\n* Width -- **3 out of 10**\n* Depth -- **3 out of 10**\n* Offensive Style -- **Possession**  or **Balanced** (Your goal here is to hold on. Not to score.)\n* Width -- **4 out of 10**\n* Players In Box -- **1 out of 10**\n* Corners -- **1 out of 5**\n* Free Kicks -- **1 out of 5**\n\n**My 352 Isn't Working:**  Use this when you just can't seem to create any scoring opportunities. I switch to this for about 1 opponent every weekend only. 4222 with the same Tactics as **Standard Play.**\n\n# 4. Player Archetypes for Each Position in My 352\n\nA player archetype simply means the type of player I aim to use in each position. I will name who I use have used and give a brief overview of why that player is great for the 352. You can then find similar players.\n\nGoalkeeper: **Marc Andre Ter Stegan** Keepers are trash. Go with who you can fit in.\n\nOutside Centerbacks: **PM Ramos, TOTS Carvajal.** Your outside CBs should be solid defenders with good agility and balance. Huge plus if they are able to pass well.\n\nCentral Centerback: **FB Boateng.** Your sole inside CB should be a rock. Typical CBs like VVD [et.al](https://et.al). thrive here.\n\nCentral Defensive Midfielders: **TOTS Saul, TOTY De Jong, TOTY Kante.** Your CDMs should be jacks of all trades. One should be more of a nuisance compared to the rock that the other should be. However, BOTH MUST be able to play the holding CDM role and the box to box role.\n\nWide Midfielders: **Future TOTS Davies, FBD Rapha Gurreiro, Storyline Perisic, Any Version of Marcelo, Storyline Aouar, TOTS Thiago.** You're looking for players that you can put a shadow on and still be a threat to shoot with or a hunter and still be a threat to defend with. Your wide mids can be both pacey. Or 1 pacey and 1 technical. But NEVER BOTH TECHNICAL. You will get absolutely burned on the wing without at least one pacey player. My rule of thumb here is that Skill Moves + Weak Foot should be equal to at least 8. That means 4\\*4\\*, 5\\*3\\*, or 3\\*5\\*. This will allow you to be much less one- dimensional out wide.\n\nCentral Attacking Midfielder: **Future TOTS Reus, Any version of Messi, Neymar, TOTS Giovinco.** This is your best (re: favorite) player. They should be pacey with a rocket of a shot and high passing and dribbling stats. You will want this player to feel smooth on the ball.\n\nLeft Striker: **Any Version of Messi, CR7, Neymar, Son, KDB.** This player is going to interplay with the wide mids and the Right Striker to Setup a nice little pass into the unmarked and waiting feet of your CAM for a shot.\n\nRight Striker: **Future TOTS Sancho, Mbappe, Adama.** This player is going to make runs out wide to pull your opponent's CBs out of position. They should be fast and agile with good ball control. Bonus points for good strength. They will score the fewest goals of your attacking trio but will be invaluable in setting up the other two.\n\n# 5. Substitution Philosophy\n\nYour subs are different when running the 352. In order to dominate the entire match, you will want to bring on a new LM and RM at around the 65th minute (Workhorses remember?). That only leaves you with 1 more sub. This is where it's entirely up to you. I have 4 subs on my bench. 2 wide mids, one attacker, and one CB. If I have a rather large lead and feel I don't need to attack voraciously, I will sub off my more attacking CDM for a CB. If I am not all that confident in my ability to just hold the lead, I will sub off whichever attacker feels the most sluggish and in need of a breather.\n\n# 6. My Play Style\n\nIt's all about Triangles. You have them everywhere. You should aim not take more than 2 touches before passing it off. This obviously doesn't include when you've played the ball in behind to your wide mids.\n\nOne touch passes between your LM-LCDM-LCB and its right side equivalent will draw out your opponent's forward RCAM allowing you to get in behind the RCAM and in front of the fullback. Now you can look to either the LM-CAM-LST or LM-LCDM-CAM triangles (or their right side equivalents) to do the same to beat the fullback and get in behind.\n\nIf your opponent catches on to this and begins to overload that side or manually pull players out of position to defend it, you can start to do the one touch passes between the LM-LCDM-LCB but instead of playing it forward to the LM, you can switch the play to the RM who will be in behind the opposing fullback due to your opponent's defensive slide.\n\nYou can also play the LCDM-RCDM-CCB and LCDM-RCDM-CAM triangles to do the same. The ideal situation here results in one of your CDMs making a forward run and receiving a pass. Then you play the ball off to one of your strikers. By now, your CAM has made an unmarked run from deep. You lay the ball off for an uncontested shot on goal.\n\nYou can play the ball in behind to your Right Striker (if he's truly in on goal, take the shot). He will likely be slightly out wide to the right and have pulled the opponent's LCB out with him. Your Left Striker will move centrally to look for a pass pulling the opponent's RCB to the middle of the field. Now, you are looking for one of two scenarios. The opponent's right fullback will either move centrally to mark your CAM or he will stay wide to mark your LM. Either way, you've created an unmarked player you can pass the ball off to for either a shot or a ground cross.\n\nIf you can't create any easy shots and your opponent is sitting on the top of their box blocking everything, that's why you have two well-rounded CDMs. Interplay between your CDMs, your CAM, and your Wide Mids will eventually draw your opponent out resulting in an opportunity to play into one of the strikers for a shot.\n\nDon't forget your standard interplay between your front trio. Give-and-go's are always great.\n\nWhen you lose the ball, your CDMs and CBs will already be behind the ball. Thats 5 defenders to your opponent's 4. Then, your LM and RM will immediately back track due to their Come Back on Defense Instructions. Now you have 7 behind the ball (but high up the pitch) compared to your opponents max of 6.\n\nThe more you play with the formation, the more you will understand how to draw your opponents out rather than just playing in behind to Neymar and Mbappe in the 4231 and hopping you get a shot off.\n\n# 7. Tips for Making the Change to the 352\n\nWow, you've made it this far. Thanks for reading! Here is a short list of suggestion on how to make the change to the 352 from whatever formation you currently play.\n\n* Don't play any passes you aren't 100% sure will connect. You should aim for 90%+ pass accuracy each game.\n* Get players with high dribbling stats until you learn the ins and outs. This will allow you to hold the ball if you can't find passes right away\n* Be patient. Don't sprint (sprint less)\n* Practice in Squad Battles on Ultimate. The AI cheats. But if you can pass around the AI on Ultimate, you can pass against a real person who you can fool.\n* Try to think outside the box on your passes.",

            "description": "So where to begin...\n\nsome of you may know that there is increase of hackers on PC. It was, for some time, that you could not properly play Online Draft, because when you tried, you could meet hackers that would \"rage quit\" and you would still get a loss. So you would instantly end your draft with 0 wins, and be in a loss.\n\nThis bug/hack/cheat/whatever, IS being reported on official [answers.ea.com](https://answers.ea.com/) website, in the section bug reports. Sadly, in most cases there is NO official response from EA team. But if there is, then it is...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Helpful response from community manager ](https://preview.redd.it/ta3maqwjgvz61.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=709442782b8940c27c33f1c7b5a59df1df6592db)\n\n \n\nAs we can see, the problem is NOT acknowledged at all, what is worse, the problem is deflected at the user, even though there are MANY players reporting this issue with draft on PC.\n\nSince last weeks, this problem started to appear also on Online Rivals. What happens is pretty much the same (this is game captured by me)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ My personal experience from Rivals: you start the game, you see bronze team, you miraculously disconnect at the start of the game, and the game counts - you lose rank, you get no weekly points, and the game counts towards the 30 game limit ](https://reddit.com/link/nf9dpn/video/pxmf6o4qgvz61/player)\n\n \n\nIn rivals you will be met with message \"Your match result is currently under review. You will be returned to FUT Home.\"\n\nMakes you think, yeah, they will look into it, maybe solve the issue, maybe give you the win later, or something... but sadly, that never happens.\n\nLets see what happened when users started to report this issue (bug/hack/cheat) in official ea website\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ and another great response, power cycle your internet equipment ](https://preview.redd.it/wjr0ncmsgvz61.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc501fc04dde2c31771e80c88f8e9a6c6ed7f10a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ \\\\\"accusing others users of cheating\\\\\" heh accusing, funny... nonetheless once again, the user is the problem with his faulty internet connection ](https://preview.redd.it/l7epdrjtgvz61.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=f243272be4825c85a002602125d734cf5f08dbb8)\n\n \n\nSo yeah, now you cannot even properly play Division Rivals, earn points and get the rewards.\n\nNow you may say, can you atleast play FUT Champions then and earn the rewards this way? Me personally, I have not met a cheater in Champions yet, but there are already some bug reports on the official web site, and yes, you guessed right, the response is really helpful\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ another \\\\\"power cycle your equipment\\\\\", that will definitely get rid of the hackers ](https://preview.redd.it/7o4edo3vgvz61.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce827cc5d4af394aeb295956b2475b5f72ca7c80)\n\n \n\nIt is really sad that not only the EA Sports HAVE this huge problem with cheaters on PC, and the players cannot actually fully play this game as it was intented. The EA Sports do NOT acknowledge the problem, and BLAME it on the players.\n\nWhat can we as players do with it? I do not know, but I will definitely think more about buying another game.\n\nTLDR: Players cannot fully play this game on PC, there are many cheaters, and EA does not acknowledge the problem at all.",

Means alot. Keeps me motivated to dig deeper, and will. Its not hard to dump memory just takes a little time and experience.\n\nEDIT2: **People might think this is only implemented for offline. Found that the variable ADAPTIVE\\_DIFFICULTY 'ENABLED' is still on 1 whenever you join FUT/online friendlies. Whether its being used or not I'm not sure but I keep digging. Once I find enough I'll update the post later tonight.**\n\nEDIT3: Its difficult to find whether the ADD is in USE online. Still need to find the difficulty values that change by it. Didn't have alot of time yesterday. Found some lua scripts regarding skillgames and a bit more, but not really worth to post. Today is a new try at digging into ADD.",

Even the ones who left this game have come back to join in  and spend some time playing this game, which is a clusterfuck as it is.\nThe only saving grace to a shit game was the menu. And what did they do? They intentionally removed all the joy of it. It's FUT Birthday, highly regarded as one of the best promos of the game, celebrating their own fucking birthday. They make a team of consisting of meta players, the usual players who already has special cards. They nerf the probability of packing FB cards from saved packs or rewarded packs. Amidst it all they give us the worst TOTWM ever (they might as well surprise us next week lol). And then they take away the only joy people were waiting for - packing a guaranteed FUT Birthday card.\nWhy? Because the team is TOO good. The cards are TOO good. So they couldn't risk it. They couldn't risk giving to back to their customers who still stick to this shambolic game because income is all they care about EVEN AT THIS TIME. And to top it all of they intentionally added the Winter Refresh team knowing very well that's a shit group of players - a guaranteed SBC many had avoided as well. An 86 + 1 IF for  a pArTy bAg pAcK. \n\nYou're a disgrace EA Sports. The FIFA community sure is toxic but it sure as hell started from you. Biggest cheaters in the history of the gaming world.",

Was just doing a single player draft game, won 2-0 and then just before I could go back into the main menu I disconnected from PSN and the EA servers. Within a minute I was back onto PSN and reconnected to the servers. Why was I given a loss? Surely the game should know I was winning and either act like the game never happened or just give me the win since, you know, the game ended. If I've not actually clicked quit match then don't punish me.\n\nIt baffles me how every other game pretty much has a manual save feature where you can return to a game from the exact moment you saved. FIFA itself now has a jump in gameplay mechanic in Career Mode. In any offline part of FIFA, why is this option to manually save during a game and join at any time not a thing? Any offline match should be saved regularly so in the instance of a disconnect you can jump back in. I mean there's no reason why FUT offline games can't be played without being online anyway and then they could just add up your points for things like Squad Battles when you reconnect to the servers.\n\nThen with online why not give the player a minute window to reconnect to the server before the game properly ends? It could reconnect you and say \"would you like to reconnect to game lobby?\"\n\nJust annoying how my 15k has just been wasted for absolutely no reason other than EA's incompetence and inability to benefit the player in situations that aren't their fault.",

You immediately realize that your ping is 147, and by checking profiles, also realize that out of the 9 other players on the server, only two are on your continent. At no point did you have a chance to adjust your matchmaking preferences. However, before entering the match, the game did show that your connection was a perfect A+. \n\nOnce you begin the warmup, you notice that all your actions only happen on the second press. However, your movement responds to your controls just fine, but varies from approximately 65% speed to approximately 143%. \n\nThen everyone has loaded onto the server, but two players on the enemy team want to watch all the pregame information. About the same map they've played at least five hundred hours of. \n\nWarmup ends, and you buy what you need. However, the game decides that you actually wanted to buy 7 decoys and another P2000. As soon as the round begins, your teammate pauses the game, and you have no idea why. After 30 seconds, the game resumes, and you make your way to bombsite B, along with a teammate. Moments later, you notice enemies and the bomb at A, and start to rotate. However, you cannot move for 13 seconds, since your leg is temporarily broken.\n\nAs you finally arrive at the site, having fixed your leg and fought the delayed controls, you manage to get a headshot. But, unlike the previous match where a headshot did 110 damage, this time it only does 86. This does not apply to your enemy, who kills you, winning the round for their team. You and your teammates then get to enjoy highlights from that round, in which you utterly humiliate yourselves, but not before you witness the opposing teams 2 minute performance of Gangnam Style to celebrate. \n\nThis continues until the game is at 14-14. Miraculously, and obviously without any sort of assistance from the game, you have pulled it back from 0-14 to 14-14. All but one of the enemy teams players have quit, leaving just the one guy (who by the way lives 14500km away from your city) and 4 bots. It's down to a 5vs1, and you are just about to secure the lead for the first time, when the last guy quits. \n\nYou are taken back to the menu, and a pop-up tells you that since you were not winning, the game has been declared a tie.",

It's only at this point that you realize that the best player on the enemy team was in fact a semi-professional player, and has played over 120 hours within the past two weeks. Another enemy player has also clocked in over 100 hours, adding to his total of 7600 hours. However, the remaining three players, who combined for 11 kills, have only played less than 25 hours each. \n\nYou, on the other hand, are a casual yet enthusiastic player, and you just reached the 500 hour mark. Checking your teammates profiles, you begin with the guy who carried you to the (almost) comeback, and find out that he is an *actual* pro player. But just as you've begun to wonder how you could even be losing at any point with such a great player on your team, you see that the remaining three guys are in their first game. But in no way was that apparent, since somehow they still managed to get as many kills as you. Yet again, completely without the game helping them. Not even when they apparently each used at least 5000 euros on skins.",

You are going onto the site and you have him on perfect sight. You carefully aim for his head and shoot, but for some reason your bullet has went completely opposite direction. You swear loudly, try to take shot 2nd time, 3rd time but all of them are miss. Out of frustration, you randomly shot, not even in the opponents direction - AND IT IS INSTA KILL HEADSHOT with your P2000 even though opponent had a helmet and full health. \"Oh this is great, DDA are just in time yet again\" you think to yourself. \n\nYou are going to the bomb to finally defuse it. It is going smoothly until 4.1 seconds in-for unknown reason game lags and you stop defusing it.  Game is completely frozen. You are panicking because if it doesn't unfreeze you are going to tie the game.  Speed-up lag is happening and you are running towards the opposite end of the map. All hope is lost. But chill dude, it doesn't really matter because:\n\n\"Your match result is currently under review. You will be returned to CS:GO home\"",

May 22nd. After the community had to literally beg for them, EA released league upgrade packs. However, unlike the league specific 25k packs they released for other promos and for TOTS last year, they released an SBC that turned 11 rare premier league players into two untradeable 81+ rated premier league players. These were terrible value and quite clearly not what the community had been asking for.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/easportsfifa/status/1130971742304817152?s=21\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nick28t/status/1130972648362504192?s=21\n\n- 98.

The EPL TOTS was due to be released. However, it got leaked, and in classic EA style the defence stat on the Van Dijk card was wrong.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/w1fuPKe\n\n- 95, May 10th. TOTS MC arrived! However, the tweet showing the team included players only available through SBCs, meaning users thought they’d packed a TOTS such as Sissoko and the regular card was showing up as a mistake. In response to this EA added the three affected players to the packable TOTS set and gave everyone who packed the normal cards the TOTS version as well.\n\n https://twitter.com/easportsfifa/status/1126897960782970880?s=21\n\nhttps://twitter.com/easportsfifa/status/1126944422862643200?s=21\n\n- 94.

EA released a new batch of Icon SBCs. However, (this is gonna be a long one) instead of the Prime Icon Moments SBCs that were promised, normal Prime Icon SBCs were released. The community was blamed for this as we didn’t like the fact the SBCs were costing too much compared to the cards market value. Instead of working on making the cards on the market cheaper they decided to not release the SBCs...\n\n- (cont.) Even though they stated in a FAQ that there would be no more Prime Icon SBCs, Scholes, Litmanen, and Lehmann never got any Icon SBC, and Prime Icon Moments Ronaldo was unattainable as he was extinct on the market at 15 million coins, EA accepted no blame or admitted any wrongdoing...\n\n- (cont.) The community simply didn’t spend enough money on a game they had already bought for EA’s latest cash-grab when Prime Icon Moments were in packs. To top it all off the background images on the Prime Icon SBCs were the ones for Prime Icon Moments SBCs.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/easportsfifa/status/1116748092626223105?s=21\n\nhttps://twitter.com/futdonk/status/1116749796440793088?s=21\n\n- 80.

Mar 15th. Champions and Europa League MOTM/Hero cards were released. However, while Ronaldo played the majority of the game on the left wing his hero card was a striker. This decision was defended by an EA FUT Live Content Producer, who condescendingly replied to heat maps of Ronaldo’s game showing he played left wing and questioning the striker position with ‘Probs cos he played ST...’ The position change itself probably wouldn’t have made this list but the response from the EA employee is a bit hostile and maybe sheds some light on why we’ve seen so many content mistakes this year.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/easportsfifa/status/1106631171461439489?s=21\n\nhttps://twitter.com/iamfrench_/status/1106632708304834563?s=21\n\nhttps://twitter.com/fred_mire/status/1106633540966375424?s=21\n\n- 69. Mar 12th. The Carniball promo meant new SBC challenges were released based on that days chosen nation. However, while the nation was Argentinian the SBC was German.

Mar 1st. A Prime Icon Moments SBC for Cannavaro was released. However, the tweet informing people of this showed a graphic of a 93 rated Cannavaro with different Pace, Shooting, Defending and Physical stats. To avoid the apology tweet they had to do when a very similar problem happened 13 days prior with Flashback David Luiz, the tweet was quickly deleted.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/2GBAVRE\n\nhttps://www.futbin.com/19/player/19345/Fabio%20Cannavaro/\n\n- 62.

They contained one objective they stated players would gain an untradeable inform if they assisted with an inform card in 5 separate Divison Rivals wins. However, this was wrong, as the game did not need to end in a victory for the assists to count towards the objective. This ‘issue’ was ‘fixed’ in a matter of days even though nobody wanted it to be.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/FzDIkAS\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/aumsr7/psa_you_can_complete_the_totw_weekly_objective/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/avjsew/comment/ehfsfiv/\n\n- 53.

            "description": "So I happen to come across all of these formation reviews on this sub, and how everyone explains why their tactics are so pristine and amazing.\n\nHere is how to crush their dreams, gentlemen, and ladies?\n\nThis guide is written by a guy who is pushing into DIV 2 and is 3 wins away from Div 1 with a team that costs less than 250k, ( CSL stars mostly).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mindset:**\n\nAnti meta is not a formation, its a mindset, get it through your head. There is no Formation that is going to prepare you for this divine mission. You are the guy holding the controller, Now I want you to close your eyes and think about what you hate the most when you see your opponent's squad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou guessed right, you hate the expensive and fast players. Now what I want you to do is to feel angry, grind your teeth. It is very fucking important to be enraged, but I don't want you to be fuming. It is very important to put a lid on your emotions.  let the anger fuel you, but don't let it control you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mental Tactics:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst things first,  **YOU DONT OWN PLAYERS, YOU OWN UNITS. And these units are there to carry your mission.**  What on god's fucking green earth I mean by this you might ask?\n\nI want you to think deeply and extensively about what you are about to read and then choose your players accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour Goal posts are like your girlfriend's cave of wonders.  **You are in charge of security. how you do it is not very important, but it's your dignity that is on the line. If you have to get a yellow card but stop a counterattack then by all means go break their fucking legs and spit in their face.**\n\nIf a player is too expensive and still not delivering its duties then fuck him! He is a goner. You pick players that get the job done, **DONT GET EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED TO PLAYERS.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formation: 5-2-1-2 (Read carefully)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have tried a wide range of different tactics to make my opponents hate their lives to the point of asking deep philosophical and existential questions while standing on the edge of the rooftop, but nothing comes close to the effectiveness of  **5-2-1-2.**\n\nWhy I prefer this formation over the others you might ask?\n\nThe answer is simple. All these nice looking gents who seem very well-spoken and articulate here, who carefully dissect their formation and tactics, are sweating the **Mothereffing out of the through passes this year. These are more than likely the same cutback sweats of last years who are seeking refuge in a new camp.**\n\nBut oh no my tactics are different blah blah, I play possession and fluid football and I asked fucking Bielsa himself and got his blessings.\n\nYou know these people, they even sell their nans underwear to take the W if it comes to it, so don't really believe all these **NEW AND DIFFERENT TACTICS on 21.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe got a pest issue gents. and we fumigate that shit with 3 CBS at the back. This way we ensure to not have a leakage at the back. No more through balls for Mbabpe from FC MOM's credit card.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwe are hardworking blue and white-collar workers and we don't stand against this fuckery.\n\nYou select Your 3CBS with **70 Pace** at Minimum.  This way there is less chance that they can cheese you with a through ball and their pacey crooks on a 1v1. Shadow Chem is like a condom, wear it for protection boys.\n\nFullbacks: YOU NEED 83 pace at minimum and decent DEF stats, **but make sure that these fullbacks can finish a 1V1 or goal opportunity. This is very important since it will be explained more later.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMidfielders: Your both CMs are players who can **DEFEND and head the ball well. 68+ Pace is preferred with H/H Workrates. Defense and physicality are more important than pace Imo.**\n\nYour CAM is the most important **GOAL SCORING MACHINE** in your team. He is someone rather **Tall, Fast, with decent dribbling, and AMAZING SHOOTING.** Basically, I just described **TALISCA**  for you lads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStrikers: You need 1 player who is around 88+ pace and can get behind. And another one is someone who can play well working as a **False 9.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In-game tactics:**\n\nAlthough we are playing to win and trying to ruin sweaty players' days, we are not the antichrist. We are **NOT playing dropback.** It's not because we are nice or anything remotely close to that, I believe dropback is not as good as this year, since outside the box finesse shots are absolutely free real estate.  Therefore if you leave a huge gap behind your CMs and CBs then you are asking to be molested. So be wise, and play **PRESSURE ON HEAVY TOUCH.  Do not use pressure after possession loss since your players will be out of place.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Width:** Since the most broken aspect of this game is the through balls as we mentioned briefly, we play **with 3-4 width**. Don't worry even with 3-4 width you still cover all the pitch at the back since you got LWB AND RWB, and with tight width, no ball is going to leak, unless EA SPORTS feels like a rebound has to go on a specific unmarked disgusting Mane, **at that point you know all you need is opening lightning rounds of packs to be in good terms.**\n\nDepth: **5-6,** Do not put it very low since you will leave a gap.  If you are blessed with pace freaks at the back then increase it accordingly, by adding this you will annihilate rectums harder than Bayern's infamous pressure this year. (8-2 streets won't forget).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OFFENSIVE ( what the fuck is that?) STYLE: LONGBALL**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You are going to do a lot of pressing and tracking in the game.** Get used to the possession stats of 30-70, 20-80.\n\nPossession is for weaklings. we watch Inter 2010, Chelsea 2012, Atletico 2014 UCL runs on a repeat.\n\nLong ball will help you to intercept the ball and Feed it directly to your attackers and CAM **VERY QUICKLY, without the disadvantage of your whole team pushing up too fast and leaving a gap like FAST BUILD UP.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Players in the box:** Depending on your abilities in crossing and manual defending, increase it accordingly. If you are confident that you can score headers and defend the counterattacks, then set it around 6, If you not, then lower it and enjoy crossing and then collecting rebounds. If you got **Talisca AS CAM,**  then you are covered since he is a monster in the air as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Corners**: Again if you can head and cross well increase, but only if you are not afraid of counterattacks. Corners and set pieces are one of the main chances to score for you. I personally set it at 2. but i got tall players like Paulinho, Talisca, Diego Carlos, who disrespect you in the air.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Freekicks**: I play all of them short, except when i got a good chance around 23M. I set it at 1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Your fast striker is set on stay central get in behind and stay forward.**\n\n**Your false 9 is set on stay central and False 9 ( as no one guessed) and stay forward.**\n\n**YOUR ANDERSON FUCKING TALISCA ( CAM) is set on stay forward, get into the box for the cross (Murder).**\n\n**YOUR TANKY CM is set on Stay back while attacking, and cover center.**\n\n**Your Faster CM is set on stay back while attacking, and cover wing ( VERY IMPORTANT to cover your fullbacks when they leave on Mars probe mission.)**\n\n**Your Fullbacks are both set on balanced attack and overlap. Don't select JOIN ATTACKS if you have a problem with opponent's wingers fingering your anus, if you are cool with it, then enjoy the experience.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nBrew a coffee and enjoy your day and stay focused. Track the ball, press, and leave them to pass it around while they think about their miserable lives and all the pussy that they could have gotten if only they weren't sweaty incels.\n\nTry, to feed the ball to your Front triangle and play ping pong passes there and try to find a gap to feed a through ball to your get in behind striker.\n\nUse your False 9 as a second CAM and use him for chance creation and passing around.\n\nWhen your opponent is funneling all of the players in the middle to press you, quickly switch the flanks, and feed your Fullbacks since they are not marked, run up the field with them for a good cross chance, or even take the shot if they are clear. ( **That is why you want someone who can finish).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Don't forget. Scoring is nice ONLY if you don't CONCEDE.**\n\ndon't try to impress anyone, don't do stupid random skill moves. just pass it around and bomb the middle of the pitch with your CMs. Your fullbacks will cover it themselves ( Make sure their work rates or more defensive-oriented if they are not pacey.\n\nDefending is not over until the bastard REF sings. Enjoy climbing into ranks, And don forget to leave your text messages open to get those nice and juicy salty tears from all those incels who cant no longer do that one thing that they were destined to do in this cruel world.",

            "description": "Hi FIFA fans,\n\nAs some of you heard last week, two lawyers filed a lawsuit against EA after two of their clients decided they had enough of spending money on an unfair lootbox system. Last night , both lawyers were with Psyko17 (french youtuber/streamer) on twitch last night to talk to the French Community, they explained the details of the lawsuit and what to expect from it. This is going to be a little summary in poor english for the reddit community of what I understood on stream. You can still watch the full interview in french on twitch. My translation is not a 100% accurate.\n\nThe main reason they are doing this is to get full transparency over what the consumer is really buying when spending FIFA Points on packs. Laws in France are very strict when it comes to lottery systems, odds need to be very clear. The fact that EA calls their virtual money \"Coins\" and that those can be gained through real money and also that they take a 5% cut on every card you sell is enough to have FUT be considered a Lottery System or a Casino in front of the law, EA won't be able to defend their Surprise Mechanics without providing full transparency of the pack system in the last 6 years.\n\nThey also pointed out all the shady mechanics they noticed in the game right now :\n\n\\- Odds transparency : \"<1% chance to pack a Special Card\" is not clear enough and is considered unfair to the consumer.\n\n\\- Market and Supply Regulation : they noticed that pack weight was not random like it should be in a lottery. During TOTY, they saw that the total number of TOTY De Jong on the market went from 0 to a 100 in a matter of seconds even though the lightning rounds had begun way before. This can be proved 100% with the Pele Icon card that wasn't available in packs on FIFA16 (Edit : It was on FIFA14) and suddenly EA listed 4 on the market. And the 5% cut on every trade can be considered a Casino practice. And also they noticed that the market value of a player influences the odds of packing this exact player.\n\n\\- False claims/advertising : EA still uses the term \"Promo\" to advertise their packs to consumers, even though in France using \"Promo\" means that the product needs to be sold at a discounted price, which never happens on FIFA, the price of packs never change even during Black Friday where they just make tens of millions on a event that's supposed to be about saving money.\n\n\\- Planned obsolescence/DDA : by regulating the supply and the market EA is responsible for the prices dropping during the year. And so deciding when a card will have no more value. They also raised concerns about  unfair mechanics inducing you to change team and make trades even when you have your Ultimate Team and all the best players.\n\n\\- Addicting/casino mechanics on a PEGI 3+ game : Pack animations are similar to slot machines animations and has a similar effect on the brain, these mechanics shouldn't be allowed on the game made for 3 years old.\n\nThe risks for EA if they fail to provide answers :\n\nEA can be asked to provide full transparency about pack weight on the last 6 editions of FIFA to national administration and an investigation could be opened. If EA fails to collaborate with the law, they could be facing a fine as high as 10 percent of Ultimate Team Revenue over the last 6 years. Also they will also have to pay damages to the players who spent money on FIFA Points. And of course, actions will be taken in France to remove FIFA Points from the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : Thank you for the comments and upvotes. \n\nThis post proved to me how crucial transparency actually is. The reason we, as a community, are so divided is because we give a lot of time to a game that doesn’t let us know how the reward system really works (we know nothing about packs and even in game we have to figure everything out by ourselves from unclear tactic options to lazy game mechanics). So everyone comes up with their own little theory which is always based on opinion or experience more than proved facts. We know so little about the game that we can never have healthy debate.\n\nSo please don’t downvote comments because they’re not your side, explain your thoughts and hope that someone else agrees. Think bigger and realize we all here are very passionate players who all agree that the game is fucked in some way. ",

            "description": "# Summary\n\nLast year, I wrote a guide for the 352 tactics I use to earn Elite finishes in the weekend league. I was surprised by how much all of you liked it and I've been receiving some requests for a FIFA 21 reprisal.\n\n# Well, [I'm Back.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44gD94kl5CU)\n\nThree weekends into Fifa 21, I have achieved three straight Elite finishes (two Elite 2s and one Elite 2 that should have been an Elite 1 if not for a thunderstorm, a tree, and a powerline deciding to do the horizontal mambo) and I am rather confident in putting out this Fifa 21 Remastered 352 Guide. I have made some big changes and I will be sure to cover all of them below. I am going to use a format similar to the one I used previously.\n\nFirst and foremost, **No, this is not a Drop Back meta-slave setup** and once again, this is a **VERY lengthy guide** in which I will cover player types to use, instructions, tactics, and more. I spent a good amount of time working on this, so if there is anything I did not cover and you have questions please feel free to ask me! Cheers!\n\n# [Once again, lemme tell you somethin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Wof8Stc7Q)\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n1. Miscellaneous things to know before you start and FAQs.\n2. Why I like the 352 over the 4231 and 442.\n3. Custom tactics and why you need at least 3 different setups.\n4. Instructions for each position.\n5. Player Archetypes for each position in my 352.\n6. Chemistry Styles\n7. Substitution Philosophy.\n8. My play style.\n9. Tips for making the change to the 352.\n10. The teams I have used thus far and my pre-toty target.\n11. Closing Remarks\n\n# 1. Miscellaneous things to know before you start and FAQs.\n\n* This guide is best viewed in a web browser due to the use of bulleted lists and indentations.\n* Changing to the 352 will not automatically make you go from Gold 3 to Gold 1, Gold 1 to Elite 3, etc. Like anything in this life, it takes practice.\n* I am not a pro, streamer, nor youtuber. I am a regular dude who happens to like playing Fifa, a lot. I don't have any gameplay videos saved. \n* You will lose games against opponents using the 4231 and 442. The 352 is not a miracle cure.\n* Contrary to popular belief, defending with attackers has been **severely nerfed** this year. \n* Do not try to use Adama as a wide mid thinking that his pace and strength will make up for his lack of defending. **You will get exploited.**\n* A 4 star weak foot is not all that weak.\n* AI defending did **not** get a buff and AI blocks aren't as difficult to contend with as you may think (although, they are frustrating as hell when they happen)\n* Beating team press is **very easy and it's honestly just fun to exploit**. I will explain why and how in this guide.\n* With the addition of the Creative Runs, EA has severely nerfed the natural off-the-ball runs your own AI perform. For this reason, ***I highly recommend that you never use Balanced as your offensive mentality*** for any squad you are running, be it 352 or other.\n* My camera angle is the Co-op angle.\n* Interestingly, EA has added a new hidden change with respect to positional instructions that makes the 352 even more deadly. In the past, if two players swapped naturally during the run of play due to some circumstance (ie, your CDMs flip, your CAM and RCAM flip, etc), they kept the instructions of their original spot. **Not this year.** If your LCDM and RCDM flip spots naturally during the course of play, **they will also flip their instructions.** This is important for a scenario where you place complimentary instructions on your CDMs. That is, if you have your LCDM on stay back and your RCDM on get forward and you somehow dragged your LCDM forward, your RCDM **will stay back** rather than still getting forward like his instruction tells him to do. This is new and a very welcome change.\n* Big thanks to u/El-Buncho and his idea for some of the graphics I used in this guide\n\n# 2. Why I Like the 352 Over the 4231 and 442.\n\nLet's take a look at how the 352 matches up against the two meta formations. On defense, the 352 has 3 CBs, 2 wingbacks, and 2 CDMs for a total of 7 eligible defenders to contend with your opponent's attack. ***Stop thinking of your eligible defenders as separate positions. On Defense, you have 7 Defenders and their sole job is to win the ball back. Don't be afraid to pull players out of position. Don't overdo it, though.***\n\n* 4231 - This formation has 4 attackers, 2 CDMs, and 4 defenders.\n   * When you are defending against the 4231, it is very likely that your opponent has gone full meta and is using stay back on their CDMs and fullbacks. This means they have 4 attackers and 2 holding midfielders. The holding midfielders aren't a threat to do much so you don't really need to worry about them all that much. You have 7 defenders to contend with 4 attackers, 6 attackers if they use their CDMs more aggressively. Your wide midfielders can man mark the LCAM and RCAM.  Your two CDMs focus on their CAM and Striker. And your 3 CBs are gravy here. Literally cleaning up anything that gets through. (but u/wahoos22, what if they're just passing around with their CDMs and CBs? You can harass the opponent CDMs with your CAM and CBs with your strikers, if needed).\n* 442 - This formation has 2 attackers, 2 wingers, and 2 CMs.\n   * When you are defending against the 442, it is very likely that your opponent has gone full meta and is using stay back on their fullbacks and at least 1 of their CMs. This means that they have 5 attackers, 6 if they let both of their CMs get forward. In the 442, the CMs are much more of a threat than in the 4231. Your wide midfielders can mark the opponent LM and RM. Your two CDMs mark against their two CMs, and your 3 CBs take care of the 2 strikers. The more meta your opponent is, the less players going forward you will have to contend with and the easier it is to defend against.\n\nGoing on the attack, the 352 is overwhelming without leaving you caught out. This will be covered more in the **My Play Style** section.\n\n# 3. Custom Tactics and Why You Need at Least 3 Different Setups\n\nThis play style requires 3 (sometimes 4) different setups. A standard play setup, a come from behind setup, a hold on for the win setup, and a my-352-isn't-working-this-game setup (yes it will happen. sometimes you just need some variety to break down a very strong defensive opponent). **Below is a text version of the tactics with some explanations on why I choose what I choose. If you would like a visual version, please refer to these links:**\n\n* [Standard Play](https://imgur.com/a/vbb8gGB?third_party=1#_=_)\n* [Come From Behind](https://imgur.com/a/RvHTRaQ)\n* [Hold The Lead](https://imgur.com/a/tgfH84e)\n\n**Standard Play:** Use this when the game is tied, or you are up/down by only 1 or 2 goals. Basically, use this when it's a close match.\n\n* Defensive Style -- **Balanced**\n   * Width -- **4 out of 10**\n   * Depth -- **4 out of 10**\n* Offensive Style -- **Long Ball** (Last year, I used both Long Ball and Fast Build Up. This year, EA has changed the way your team comes back on defense when using Fast Build Up. Specifically, your players will be out of position more often, which is in line with the Fast Build Up description. For this reason, I no longer recommend it as an option.)\n   * Width -- **8/9 out of 10**\n   * Players In Box -- **5/6/7 out of 10** (This will vary based on the natural off the ball movement of your players. Test it out for yourself.)\n   * Corners -- **1 out of 5**\n   * Free Kicks -- **1 out of 5**\n\n**Come From Behind:** Use this when you are down late and need a quick comeback. Be careful when using this setup as **you are throwing the kitchen sink at your opponent and are very susceptible to counters.**\n\n* Defensive Style -- **Balanced** (Last year, I recommended Constant Pressure here. With the addition of Team Press, Constant Pressure is no longer worth it and actually only serves to drag your team out of position. For this reason, I no longer recommend it as an option.)\n   * Width -- **5 out of 10**\n   * Depth -- **9 out of 10** (10 out of 10 just feels glitched for some reason, ***again***)\n* Offensive Style -- **Long Ball** (Last year, I used both Long Ball and Fast Build Up. This year, EA has changed the way your team comes back on defense when using Fast Build Up. Specifically, your players will be out of position more often, which is in line with the Fast Build Up description. For this reason, I no longer recommend it as an option.)\n   * Width -- **10 out of 10**\n   * Players In Box -- **10 out of 10**\n   * Corners -- **5 out of 5**\n   * Free Kicks -- **5 out of 5**\n\n**Hold The Lead:** Use this when you are up late and need to hold on. Don't abuse it or use it for extended periods of play as DDA will kick in and you will concede.\n\n* Defensive Style -- **Drop Back** (But [u/wahoos22](https://www.reddit.com/u/wahoos22/), you said it wasn't gonna be a drop back meta??? It's not. This is a legitimate strategy that should be employed toward the end of a match you are winning, especially against an opponent who is clearly better than you.)\n   * Width -- **3 out of 10**\n   * Depth -- **3 out of 10**\n* Offensive Style -- **Possession** (Your goal here is to hold on, not to score. Last year, I recommended both Possession and Balanced. EA changed the way your team's natural off-the-ball runs happen. Balanced is ***extremely*** static this year. For this reason, I no longer recommend Balanced.)\n   * Width -- **4 out of 10**\n   * Players In Box -- **1 out of 10**\n   * Corners -- **1 out of 5**\n   * Free Kicks -- **1 out of 5**\n\n**My 352 Isn't Working:** Use this when you just can't seem to create any scoring opportunities. I switch to this for about 1 opponent every weekend only. 4222 with the same Tactics as **Standard Play.**\n\n# 4. Instructions for Each Position\n\nSome of the positions below will have more than one set of instructions. This makes more sense given the context of section 3, immediately preceding this section.\n\n**Goalkeeper**: With how powerful through balls have become this installment of Fifa, proper goalkeeper instructions are very important. *Not to mention that crossing is back.*\n\n* Saving on Crosses -- **Comes for Crosses**\n* Saving Outside Box -- **Sweeper Keeper**\n\n**Centerbacks:** Don't touch anything.\n\n* Attacking Support -- **Stay Back While Attacking**\n* Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions** (You can choose **Aggressive Interceptions** here, but be warned: your defenders will tire faster and will make some great interceptions but can get caught out of position more easily. I don't think its worth it. **Do not use Conservative Interceptions or Neymar et.al. will have a laugh at you as they prance around your back line.)**\n\n**Center Defensive Midfielders:** Depending on your ability to defend well manually with your CBs, you can be more or less aggressive here. You will/may need 3 different sets of instructions here. If you are a weaker manual defender, you may want to use the **Hold The Lead** instructions in all setups for more security at the back. ***Be honest with yourself and your abilities.***\n\n* **Standard Play** \\-- Keeping in line with the philosophy of Standard Play, your CDMs need to be jack of all trades. ***You'll want your balanced CDM to Cover Center so that he doesn't drift wide while tracking back. Your CDM that stays back will want to Cover Wing to backup your wide mids. If one is caught out, the CDM will drift wide to cover that spot and your CCB can step forward as your LCB and RCB pinch inward. Defensive Awareness stat is very important this year for this reason.***\n   * LCDM (or RCDM, just pick one)\n      * Defensive Behavior -- **Cut Passing Lanes**\n      * Attacking Support -- **Balanced**\n      * Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions**\n      * Defensive Position -- **Cover Center**\n   * RCDM (or whichever one you didn't do first)\n      * Defensive Behavior -- **Cut Passing Lanes**\n      * Attacking Support -- **Stay Back While Attacking**\n      * Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions**\n      * Defensive Position -- **Cover Wing**\n* **Come From Behind**\n   * Both CDMs\n      * Defensive Behavior -- **Cut Passing Lanes**\n      * Attacking Support -- **Get Forward**\n      * Interceptions -- **Aggressive Interceptions**\n      * Defensive Position -- **Cover Center**\n* **Hold The Lead**\n   * Both CDMs\n      * Defensive Behavior -- **Cut Passing Lanes**\n      * Attacking Support -- **Stay Back While Attacking**\n      * Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions**\n      * Defensive Position -- **Cover Center**\n\n**Wide Midfielders:** These players are the **workhorses** of your squad. They won't score often and they won't register many assists, but if you skimp on these positions, you will get exploited. Your wide mids need to be able to defend. No, they don't need to body players like VVD, but they do need to do the job well. Outside of that, you can choose to go the pacey route or the technical route. **At the early stage of the game, I recommend pacey as it is more forgiving, especially for those switching to the formation for the first time.**\n\n* **Standard Play**\n   * Defensive Support -- **Come Back On Defense**\n   * Chance Creation -- **Balanced Width**  (Last year, I also recommended Free Roam here. With the addition of Creative Runs and the nerf to AI runs, I no longer recommend this.)\n   * Support Runs -- **Balanced** (Last year, I recommended Get In Behind here. I did this because we were also using Fast Build Up. With the nerf -- more of a correction than a nerf -- to Fast Build Up, we no longer need Get In Behind because of the Long Ball mentality.)\n   * Support on Crosses -- **Balanced** (Last year I recommended Stay On Edge Of Box For Cross. I stated that the reason for this was \"because the game is weird and the Stay on Edge instruction helps to stop your players from over-running passes.\" Given that EA has fixed that ***beyond stupid*** overrunning mechanic, this is no longer necessary and we can use the much more logical Balanced option.)\n   * Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions**\n* **Come From Behind**\n   * Both LM and RM\n      * Defensive Support -- **Stay Forward**\n      * Chance Creation -- **Stay Wide**\n      * Support Runs -- **Get In Behind**\n      * Support on Crosses -- **Get Into Box For Cross**\n      * Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions**\n* **Hold The Lead**\n   * Both LM and RM\n      * Defensive Support -- **Come Back on Defense**\n      * Chance Creation -- **Balanced**\n      * Support Runs -- **Come Short**\n      * Support on Crosses -- **Stay On Edge of Box For Cross**\n      * Interceptions -- **Normal Interceptions**\n\n**Central Attacking Midfielder:** Once again, your CAM is your most important player and will score the majority of your goals. His instructions are the same in all setups. It may sound strange, but this really is your best player. He will not only score the most goals, but will have the most assists. (But [u/wahoos22](https://www.reddit.com/u/wahoos22/), that doesn't make any sense! Your CAM should be the creator for the strikers!?!? Normally you'd be right. More on why in the My Play Style section).\n\n* Defensive Support -- **Stay Forward**\n* Support On Crosses -- **Balanced** (Last year, I recommended Stay On Edge Of Box For Cross. I stated that the reason for this was \"because the game is weird and the Stay on Edge instruction helps to stop your players from over-running passes.\" Given that EA has fixed that ***beyond stupid*** overrunning mechanic, this is no longer necessary and we can use the much more logical Balanced option.)\n* Positioning Freedom -- **Free Roam** or **Stick To Position** (This depends on the natural off-the-ball movement of your CAM. Test it out for yourself. I tend to like Stick To Position better this year. Just don't use Drift Wide. It's trash for your CAM.)\n* Interceptions -- **Conservative Interceptions** (Lower stamina players will not tire as quickly with Conservative instructions. If stamina isn't an issue, you can use Normal).\n\n**Strikers:** Again, it may sound strange, but these players are more creators than goal scorers (but having absolute rockets of shots here doesn't hurt!). **This year, you need at least one striker that is good in the air. More on why in section 7.**\n\n* **Standard Play** and **Come From Behind**\n   * Left Striker -- A playmaker and space creator\n      * Support Runs -- **Drift Wide** (Last year, I recommended Stay Central on the Left Striker. With the addition of Creative Runs and the nerf to AI runs, I have experimented and found that Drift Wide on both strikers results in a much more dynamic and mobile front line. I recommend either Balanced or Drift Wide, but never Stay Central unless you're using a player like Ibrahimovic or Giroud, who are just slower than drying paint.)\n      * Attacking Runs -- **Balanced** (Last year, I had a firm recommendation for Balanced on the Left Striker. This year, I no longer have a hard recommendation. Similar to the CAM, this instruction will depend on the natural movement of your chosen player. Test it out for yourself.)\n      * Interceptions -- **Conservative Interceptions** or **Normal Interceptions**\n      * Defensive Support -- **Stay Forward**\n   * Right Striker -- A playmaker and space creator\n      * Support Runs -- **Drift Wide**\n      * Attacking Runs -- **Get In Behind**\n      * Interceptions -- **Conservative Interceptions** or **Normal Interceptions**\n      * Defensive Support -- **Stay Forward**\n* **Hold The Lead**\n   * Both Strikers\n      * Support Runs -- **Balanced**\n      * Attacking Runs -- **False-9**\n      * Interceptions -- **Conservative Interceptions** or **Normal Interceptions**\n      * Defensive Support -- **Come Back On Defense**\n\n# 5. Player Archetypes for Each Position in My 352\n\nA player archetype simply means the type of player I aim to use in each position. **My top choice in each section will be bolded. Note that just because a player is my top choice doesn't mean I am currently using them. Also, note that I will not be bolding any icons here because that wouldn't be useful information.** I will give cheap (under 100k), middle of the road (under 500k), and expensive (500k+) options for each position. ***Please keep in mind that these are examples of players you can use. Some are better value for coins in terms of what they provide to your team versus the costs to buy them. For instance, Cancelo is probably a better option over Walker for RM -- not only will Cancelo be better as a RM and is cheaper, but also NIF Walker is better suited for an outside CB role in the 352.***\n\n* Goalkeepers\n   * Literally whatever you want. Goalkeepers are a ***feel*** type of thing. I like Neuer\n* CBs - Try to get a Lefty at LCB (or at least 3 star weak foot Righty) and put the least agile CB you have at the CCB position\n   * **Klosterman**, Laimer, Manolas, Alaba, Diego Carlos, Koulibaly, Llorente, Valverde, Zakaria, IF Delaney\n   * VVD, Joe Gomez, **Varane**, NIF Walker, Mendy, Rule Breaker Laporte\n   * **IF Walker**, 85 Ferdinand, 92 Maldini, 87 Carlos Alberto\n* CDMs\n   * Alaba, Llorente, Valverde, Zakaria, Fred, **Wijnaldum**, IF Delaney\n   * Kante, Pogba, Baby Lahm, KDB, **IF Sanches**\n   * Gullit (mid or prime when it comes out), Zidane (mid or prime when it comes out)\n* LM/RMs\n   * **Davies**, IF Florenzi, IF Corona, Jordi Alba, Atal, Cancelo, Cuadrado, Hakimi, Gosens\n   * **Mendy**, Walker\n   * Zambrotta, Roberto Carlos, Ashley Cole\n* CAM\n   * Reus, Carrasco, Dembele, Ben Yedder *(Eww)*, Dybala, IF Depay, Griezmann, **Hazard**, Mertens, League Objective Mollet, Bobby\n   * RuleBreaker Reus, KDB, Salah, **Mane**, Son, Rule Breaker Costa, IF Bobby, RuleBreaker Costa, POTM Fati, \n   * **Neymar**, Messi, Cruyff\n* Strikers\n   * **Lewa**, Haaland, Carrasco, Ben Yedder *(Eww)*, Sterling, Sane, Aguero, Richarlison, Rodrigo, IF Depay, Vardy, Mertens, Jesus\n   * Rashford, Salah, **Mane**, Werner, IF Lewa, Aubameyang, RuleBreaker Lukaku, POTM Fati,\n   * **CR7**, Mbappe, Messi, R9\n\n# 6. Chemistry Styles\n\nI will outline the **typical** chemistry styles I use for each position. Just because I typically use a certain style, doesn't mean I always do so. There are exceptions to every rule.\n\n* Goalkeepers\n   * Eh? Basic is fine. Glove too\n* CBs\n   * Depending on the CB, you'll likely want shadow\n      * At this stage, you can get away with Catalyst on some of the top tier defenders as they don't need the defending boost and the pace boost is the same (VVD for example)\n   * If its a player like Walker, I'd use Anchor over Sentinel\n      * I am a firm believer that Anchor is ***always*** better than Sentinel -- and it's not for the pace boost either. I like the defensive boosts of Anchor better than Sentinel\n* CDMs\n   * Shadow, Catalyst, or Engine\n      * Physicality is important in the midfield but Pace is more important to ensure they can track back quickly enough to be in position\n* Wide Mids\n   * Hunter or Catalyst\n      * I typically use Fullbacks as my Wide Mids and they typically have high enough defending that they don't need a boost. If your Wide Mid already has around 75 defending, don't worry about boosting their defending.\n      * **I am using Gladiator on Davies**\n* CAM\n   * This varies wildly. \n   * Hunter on Neymar, Artist on CR7, Catalyst on Ben Yedder, Finisher on Depay, etc\n      * *^(plz don't run cr7 at CAM)* \n* Strikers\n   * Hunter, Finisher, Engine\n\n# 7. Substitution Philosophy\n\nYour subs are different when running the 352. In order to dominate the entire match, you will want to bring on a new LM and RM at around the 60th to 65th minute (***Workhorses remember?***). That only leaves you with 1 more sub. This is where it's entirely up to you. I have 4 subs on my bench. 2 wide mids, one attacker, and one defender. If I have a rather large lead and feel I don't need to attack voraciously, I will sub off my more attacking CDM for my defensive CDM **(if any of my CBs or CDMs has a yellow, I will sub them off instead for the added security of not getting a red card**). If I am not all that confident in my ability to just hold the lead, I will sub off whichever attacker feels the most sluggish and in need of a breather. ***If you get to the point that your attackers are Neymar, Mbappe, and CR7, well congrats! Never sub them off lol***\n\n# 8. My play style\n\n***I will save you some time here. Not much has changed in the play style department. Feel free to re-read as a refresher. In this section, changes from last year have been bolded for easy reference.***\n\nIt's all about Triangles. You have them everywhere. You should aim not take more than 2 touches before passing it off. This obviously doesn't include when you've played the ball in behind to your wide mids.\n\nOne touch passes between your LM-LCDM-LCB and its right side equivalent will draw out your opponent's forward RCAM allowing you to get in behind the RCAM and in front of the fullback. Now you can look to either the LM-CAM-LST or LM-LCDM-CAM triangles (or their right side equivalents) to do the same to beat the fullback and get in behind.\n\nIf your opponent catches on to this and begins to overload that side or manually pull players out of position to defend it, you can start to do the one touch passes between the LM-LCDM-LCB but instead of playing it forward to the LM, you can switch the play to the RM who will be in behind the opposing fullback due to your opponent's defensive slide.\n\nYou can also play the LCDM-RCDM-CCB and LCDM-RCDM-CAM triangles to do the same. The ideal situation here results in one of your CDMs making a forward run and receiving a pass. Then you play the ball off to one of your strikers. By now, your CAM has made an unmarked run from deep. You lay the ball off for an uncontested shot on goal.\n\nYou can play the ball in behind to your Right Striker (if he's truly in on goal, take the shot). He will likely be slightly out wide to the right and have pulled the opponent's LCB out with him. Your Left Striker will move centrally to look for a pass pulling the opponent's RCB to the middle of the field. Now, you are looking for one of two scenarios. The opponent's right fullback will either move centrally to mark your CAM or he will stay wide to mark your LM. Either way, you've created an unmarked player you can pass the ball off to for either a shot or a ground cross.\n\nIf you can't create any easy shots and your opponent is sitting on the top of their box blocking everything, that's why you have two well-rounded CDMs **and why Creative Runs have been added. Practice making use of the Creative Run mechanic to 1) make a custom run to play a pass or 2) make a custom run to clear some space for you to dribble.** Also, interplay between your CDMs, your CAM, and your Wide Mids will eventually draw your opponent out resulting in an opportunity to play into one of the strikers for a shot.\n\n**Don't forget that crossing is back.**\n\nDon't forget your standard interplay between your front trio. Give-and-go's are always great.\n\n**With the addition of the Team Press mechanic, you need a consistent and safe way to beat that press. As you may have noticed, the Team Press mechanic is essentially a command to \"go man mark tight like you're playing one-on-one basketball.\" It's extremely effective against an opponent that panics. If you have at least one striker who is good in the air (CR7, Haaland, Lewa, Lukaku, Giroud lol, Rashford with Marksman, etc) essentially you have a free attempt at goal waiting for you. As soon as you see the team press coming, immediately pass back all the way to your CBs or even keeper. You're trying to draw your opponent in to your half. Then, play a lobbed pass up to your striker, head it down to your CAM/other Striker and you've got an instant goal scoring opportunity.**\n\nWhen you lose the ball, your CDMs and CBs will already be behind the ball. That's 5 defenders to your opponent's 4. Then, your LM and RM will immediately back track due to their Come Back on Defense Instructions. Now you have 7 behind the ball (but high up the pitch) compared to your opponents max of 6.\n\nThe more you play with the formation, the more you will understand how to draw your opponents out rather than just playing in behind to ASM and Adama in the 4231 and hopping you get a shot off.\n\n# 9. Tips for Making the Change to the 352\n\nWow, you've made it this far. **Thank you for reading the Remastered version of my guide**! Here is a short list of suggestions on how to make the change to the 352 from whatever formation you currently play.\n\n* Don't play any passes you aren't 100% sure will connect. You should aim for 90%+ pass accuracy each game. **Looking at my losses in weekend league, they all have 1 thing in common: below 90% pass accuracy.**\n* Get players with high dribbling stats until you learn the ins and outs. This will allow you to hold the ball if you can't find passes right away\n* **Don't be afraid to just stand still with your CDM** if your opponent is just sitting on their box. Eventually, they'll get frustrated, press you, and leave an open pass for you to make\n* Be patient. **Don't sprint** (sprint less)\n* Practice in Squad Battles on Ultimate. The AI cheats, **especially with that B.S. competitive setting that was added this year**. But if you can pass around the AI on Ultimate, you can pass against a real person who is actually capable of making mistakes.\n* Try to think outside the box on your passes. **Play a lobbed pass (square on PS4, X on xbox) from your RCB to your LCDM, for instance**\n* Don't be afraid to pass all the way back to your CBs and your keeper. Resetting is often helpful in luring out your opponent's defense.\n\n# 10. The teams I have used thus far and my pre-TOTY target\n\n* Week 1\n   * Elite 2\n      * [Pre-game](https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/2249646)\n      * [In-game](https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/2249666)\n* Week 2\n   * Elite 2\n      * [Pre-game](https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/2249691)\n      * [In-game](https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/2249697)\n* Week 3\n   * Elite 2 (should really have been elite 1. My power went out in game 30 while I was on 26 wins and was leading 3-1)\n      * [Pre-game](https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/2249708)\n      * [In-game](https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/2249716)\n* Pre-TOTY Target Squad (the icons in this squad are just placeholders for icons earned from Icon Swaps, an obvious caveat here is that promo cards that have yet to be released may shift what my goal is)\n   * [Pre-game](https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/2249796)\n   * [In-game](https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/2249801)\n   * [4222 example](https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/2379826)\n      * Using the same players for when you need some variation to break down your opponent. Here you can see how I would line up without making subs. \n      * If you can, you'd use your attacking substitute to fill out one of the wide CAMs\n\n# 11. Closing Remarks\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you so much for reading. I am not a pro fifa player, I'm not a youtuber or twitch streamer. I just play fifa. I really hate that people feel pigeon-holed into using a meta formation. That is why I am continuing to share my 352 tactics with all of you. I will try to respond to as many comments as I can. Thanks again!\n\n# [Now, go and burn the meta!](https://imgur.com/gallery/kiPMApg)",

            "description": "Hey guys.  \n\nYou all might have seen me popping into a few threads recently with some stat-based rambling on certain points.  I’ve also the author of the [Tinfoil Hat Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/be7q9w/rfifa_tinfoil_hat_survey/) and the [Toxic Behavior Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/hsy4i2/rfifa_toxic_behavior_survey/) (keep an eye out for the Gameplay Style Survey, that’s next.)  I’m a pretty shit player – have been Gold 3 pretty much since they were playing with leather balls in cow pastures – but I do like getting stuck into the stats behind things… so I started keeping an absurdly detailed WL tracking spreadsheet last season that provides quite a lot of info.  Figured I’d put some of the interesting stuff all down in one post.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Q: How much more offensive is FIFA 21 than FIFA 20?**\n\nA: Pretty notably.  Before I go further, I should mention that the sample size for FIFA 20 is 675 matches and so far for FIFA 21 it’s 358 matches.  All WL at a mostly Gold 3 level.\n\nGame| Goals/90 | Shots/90 | SOT/90\n---|---|----|----\nFIFA 20| 4.13 | 15.9 | 11.0\nFIFA 21 | 4.90 (+18.6%) | 17.1 (+7.5%) | 12.8 (+16.3%)\n\nOne of those percentages is not like the others.  The reason for that – shot accuracy is up significantly in 21 vs 20.  I define shot accuracy simply as (SOT / Shots); it was 69.1% in 20, and it’s 74.8% this year.  I’m not quite sure what the reason for that is, especially considering blocked shots is such a significant gripe about this year’s game.  The data suggests maybe it isn’t, but I’m not 100% sure.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Q: Is it better to play at home as opposed to away?**\n\nA: Probably not.  I only added this to my tracking this year, but in my 358 matches I’ve been at home 194 times and on the road 164 times.  I’m 101-93 at home and 81-83 on the road.  Before you say \"hey your home record’s better!” – I win 50.8% of my games and 52% of my home games.  My home record’s only 2.5 games better than my overall record in a 194 game sample – far from anything statistically significant.  \n\nThere is, however, a fairly sizable disparity in how frequently I’m at home vs. on the road.  I play on the US east coast between 9pm-2am local time on a wired connection, for what it’s worth.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Q: Is it easier to play later in the weekend?**\n\nA: Unsurprisingly yes.  I suck for the most part and am 69-87 on Fridays, 81-73 on Saturdays, and 32-16 on Sundays.  \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Q: Tell me what you’ve learned about finishing.**\n\nA: Sure.  First of all, it’s REMARKABLY consistent in the mid-to-high 30s outside of your usual game-to-game and WL-to-WL variance.  Another chart for you:\n\nGame| SOT (Mine / Opp) | My SOT Scored % | Opp SOT Scored %\n---|---|----|----\nFIFA 20 | 3,537 / 3,958 | 38.9% | 36.4%\nFIFA 21 | 2,227 / 2,396 | 38.8% | 37.2%\n\nLike I said, it bounces around a bit from weekend to weekend.  The lowest I’ve ever seen in a weekend is 28.9%, and the highest is 45.6%.  Anything lower than 33% and you feel like it’s one of those WLs where absolutely nothing is going in, and anything above 41-42 or so and you feel like 1970s Brazil.  \n\nAnother consistent stat across all 1,033 matches – for both me and my opponents, it’s 46-48% finishing in wins and 25-27% finishing in losses.  Of all the skills you can work on and cards you can buy in FIFA, by far the most important is sticking the round thing in the rectangular thing when you have the chance to do so.  I mean, duh, but worth mentioning.\n\nAnother point here -  GKs simply don’t matter as long as they’re WL standard.  I’ve used a ton of different GKs across these 1,033 matches and there isn’t a single one that has a significant and consistent effect on how many shots get saved.  Height also isn’t all that relevant either.  Get an 87+ OVR GK that chems your CBs and don’t worry about the rest.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Q: I hit the post way more than my opponent and it really sucks.**\n\nA: Yes, it sucks, and no, you probably don’t.  I’ve hit the post 68 times this year and my opponents have rattled the woodwork 57 times.  Note that’s shots that bounce out.  I define shots that hit the post and go in as shots on target.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Q: How often are people using Formation X?  How about Formation Y?**\n\nA: The narrow 4231 remains king, even this year.  I check my opponent’s formation at HT of every WL match to collect this data.  I made a post about this in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/l0hx0i/352_is_the_ultimate_meta_killer/gjtzycm/), but here’s the data with FIFA 20 frequency data included for comparison:\n\nForm| Freq | % in FIFA 21 | % in FIFA 20\n---|---|----|---\n4231 N | 74 | 20.7 | 27.1\n442 | 55 | 15.4 | 8.8\n433 ATT | 40 | 11.2 | 9.8\n442 DEF | 28 | 7.8 | 3.1\n41212 N | 20 | 5.6| 10.1\n4222 | 17 | 4.7| 4.8\n4231 W | 16 | 4.5| 4.5\n433 DEF | 12 | 3.4| 4.3\n4411 | 12 | 3.4 | 4.2\n4321 | 12 | 3.4 | 2.8\n41212 W | 11 | 3.1 | 5.5\n433 | 9 | 2.5 | 2.4\n352 | 5 | 1.3 | 1.3\n\n\nIf you have questions about the more obscure formations, drop a comment (AND LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE HURRRR).  But if you don’t see them above, I see them pretty rarely.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Q: r/FIFA loves to woof about 45’ and 90’ goals.  What say you on that, professor?**\n\nA: It’s a thing, but barely.  Here’s the distribution of the time all 1,763 goals in my FIFA 21 WL matches: [Goal Distribution Chart](https://imgur.com/NUxzzuv)  \n\nNow HOLD ON before you conspiracy theorists feel the rush of blood to your down belows.  Two things to note here:\n\n* I define any goal scored in first half stoppage time as being scored on 45’.  This is because I don’t want to foul up the data for the start of the second half.\n* I’ve gone to extra time 11.4% of the time this year.  In this chart, I’m controlling for that in 91’-122’ timeframe otherwise there would be far fewer goals on that side of the chart.  We’re looking for rate stats here, not raw goal totals.\n\nFirst off - it’s all but impossible to score in the first two minutes of halves.  TWO of the 1,763 goals show up in minutes 1, 2, 46, and 47.\n\nNow for the 45/90/105/120 thing.  If you halve the 54 goals scored on 45’ in this chart – which you should, because it’s all goals scored from 44:00 until the first half whistle blows, which is usually 46:00 or just thereafter – it drops the rate stat to 27.  That 27 would be tied for the most frequently scored-in minute – but it’s both 44:00 and first half stoppage time.  The random distribution elsewhere says there’s probably A LITTLE something to this.  We're looking at two consecutive high-scoring minutes on 45 and 45+1, another high-scoring minute on 91-92, then again on 105 and 120?  It’s there.  It’s not a holy-shit-pull-the-fire-alarm revelation, but even for an ardent anti-FIFA-bullshit person like me – I think it’s a tiny bit there.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Q: EA casts a nasty magic spell on me when I go up 2-0 or 3-0 and they make me lose every time.  Is 2-0 really a dangerous lead?**\n\nA: Only if you aren’t good at holding leads.  I barked about this in a thread last night and said...\n\n* I've gone 2-0 up 71 times.  I'm 65-6 in those matches.\n* I've gone 2-0 down 101 times.  I'm 10-91 in those matches.\n* I've gone 3-0 up 48 times and have never lost.\n* I've gone 3-0 down 72 times and have won only one once, and it was on pens.\n\nIf you go up 2 and you don't change tactics to slow it down a bit, be a little more defensive, and look for counters - that's your own fault.  By r/fifa standards I am shit at this game and I've only lost 6 times after going up 2-0.\n\nCombined - both me and my opponents, once one of us goes up 2-0 - the other guy only comes back to win 9.3% of the time.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Q: How important is it to score first?**\n\nA: Important, yes, but even more than you might think.  This was another data point I added to my tracking this year.  In 358 games, I’ve scored first in 177 and my opponent’s scored first in 180.  I’m 131-46 when I score first and 51-129 when I don’t (there’s a 120’ 0-0 in there for you eagle eyed readers.)  Says that for a G3 pleb like me, the first goalscorer wins 73% of the time.  This coupled with the 2-0 / 3-0 data above – there’s something to be said for going for the throat early in a match.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Q: What’s the story with the WL elo / “Form” / matchmaking system?**\n\nA: It works.  In all my matches, my win rate drops as my Form goes up and it rises as my Form goes down, and the progression is almost linear:\n\n* In 21 my win % goes 83 – 62 – 70 – 55 – 41 – 37 – 24 as my Form goes from -4 to +2.\n* In 20 my win % goes 81 – 69 – 64 – 59 – 52 – 44 – 31 – 31 – 25 as my Form goes from -3 to +5.  \n\nI’m all but certain the Form system is active during your first five placement matches, but don’t have quite the amount of data as I’d like to be 100% sure.\n\nOne thing I do think is a little suspect – there are a TON of streaks in WL.  This is also something a lot of you have said you experience – you’ll often times win 3 or 4 in a row, even as a G2/G3 player.  55% of all my weekends have at least one four-match winning or losing streak, which seems like a lot for a player who very reliably wins 51% of his matches.  Yes, I know the Form system plays a role in this – but I’m not talking about going from 9-1 to 10-8.  I’m trying to dispel a lot of myths here, but It feels to me like there might be a little more to matchmaking than just Form.  For example I am 52-42 this year when my Form is -1.  But a disproportionate number of those losses come as a part of streaks.  This is my next project; I have all the data, I’m just working on the best way to glean good info from it.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nThat’s all I got.  Any questions, requests, recommendations for me to be put in a mental institution, let’s hear it.  Hope you found this somewhat insightful, interesting, or even just a useful time killer while we suffer this interminable wait to get all of TOTY into packs.  Good luck this Friday guys.",

            "description": "I think its safe to say a majority of the community wanted changes in the summer to this mode. This weeks 4 day weekend league is clearly 1000x more appealing as it lets us relax a bit more and not rush so much, which makes the game far less frustrating. We are not esports stars, we should not have to play in the mindset of one by putting in huge long sessions and neglecting friends, partners, other interests and commitments just to compete.\n\n  Real football fans will lose 2-10 hours a weekend watching games. Workers and Schoolkids lose most of Friday. And anybody with a family or social life loses much more.  \n\nIt makes no sense to not give us this extra day, it will allow many more people time to play games and enjoy the mode. As it currently stands it is not healthy to put the tight time and amount of pressure on young people. FIFA is an addictive game. I have multiple friends who just dont have time to play every weekend and would love the extra evening to put in a few more games even if it just means they make silver 1.   An important thing i saw mentioned is the invention of Squad Battles. Anyone wanting to finish well needs to play a lot of matches of that in a weekend, just adding further congestion with Weekend League.\n\n  \nEA were willing to listen last year so we just have to ask again now. Keep this thread going and keep repeating the message. Send it out to as many people as you can on social media.\n\nhttps://fifaforums.easports.com/en/discussion/320442/petition-4-day-weekend-league/p1?new=1  \n  \n  \n  \nSupport has been brilliant so far, 1000 votes in 7 hours.

I also know from this sub that it really bothers a lot of people.\n\nSo I had an idea to remove this issue.\n\nWhat if, when you concede a goal, the conceding team gets their own set of controlable animations to watch? For example if you concede from a corner you could have an animation where your GK and CB are arguing. Or if you concede an early goal you could have your captain clapping his hands and hyping up your team to go again. Or if you concede a goal that looked a bit dodgy you could have your manager shouting at the 4th official. There could be multiple animations that you select yourself for soajy situations. And if you choose to skip it just shows your players walking back to the half way line until your opponent has skipped or watched their celebration. \n\nI think this would totally remove any notion of toxic behaviour as people would know they are the only one seeing their celebration. It would also add a level of realism to the game and give you a cool animation to get yourself going after conceding.\n\nWould love to know what people think of my idea!",

Somehow the guy goes up 1:0 and starts shushing me. And not just a short shush, the guy literally runs across half the field, till all time runs out and still watches all replays. But I come back pretty quickly, skip replays and continue. He goes ahead 2:1 in the 40th, proceeds to shush again, and watch all replays. I come back 2:2 before the 45th.\n\nSecond half ensues, he scores in the 55th, shushes, watches all the replays. But then he started wasting time, the guy literally played the ball to his GK, stood there for a minute passed in forwards, runs to My box, and then plays it back to his GK. \n\nSo at this point I go full attacking, team pressure and what not. And somehow in the 80th minute I come back to 3:3. Skip all replays again, because I know now I can win this game and I’m saving my celebrations for a later point. Opponent starts passing it round the back again, guess he wants to get to extra time. But after wasting time with his GK again, I manage to intercept one of his passes and I score the 4:3 in the 90th minute. Of course I return the favor and start shushing him, and to put a cherry on top a nice little dab. My opponent rage quits 😂... \n\nI swear this felt like Christmas, I felt like I had just gotten T100. The pure joy of beating some toxic, provocative player.

You knew you had time from work or school,  you played 7 games and got promoted and got coins. Simple as that. Ever since fut champs was introduced, the game has turned into a race where you miss couple weeks and you fall so far behind the power curve.\n\nMyself like many others have work, maybe school, social life, hobbies etc which obviously need balancing as well, and whenever you have time to get into fut, you just realize how far from others you are. Not a single game mode anymore is for casual playing, I have not enjoyed the game like before. I know it’s partly nostalgia, but I remember rushing to my playstation to open Fifa 15 etc even with the flaws they had. It was fun. Now the game is not fun, because EA has turned it into a game mode where you need to play consistently every single week. And yeah the meta is worse than ever these last couple years. I have tried to play champs probably 10 times since it was introduced, I get gold 2 but in the end, I realize I did not enjoy it at all.\n\n\nI can say from experience that even with the same schedule in life, missing weeks of playing from earlier fifas was never such a loss as it is now.\n\nFree to share your thoughts.",

I wish they added more player objectives to milestone, so that when you want to do it, you can. The time limit is the most frustrating part of the game..",

            "description": "Fellow redditors!\n\nSome of you may remember a post doing the rounds on here a while back, about a researcher opening packs for science. That’s me! So, I’ve now opened €3800 worth of packs and have published my findings and views on the whole thing at GREF 2018, a conference for the European gambling regulators.\n\nI thought it was a good idea to share the raw data with everyone here, so that anyone who wants can have a look at them and see for themselves how it all panned out.\n\nHere’s the gist of it:\n\nStarting in February, ending (for now) in may, I’ve spent 453650 Fifa points (worth approx €3800 when purchasing bundles of 12000 points only).\n\nI’ve opened 651 packs and catalogued every single item, and checked the value of all items agains fubtin.com at the time of opening.\n\nIn total, I pulled 9961 items, of which 6992 were player cards, and 4483 were rare gold cards\n\n70 “in-form” cards (TOTW / TOTS / Hero etc) were pulled - mostly ones of little value, with a couple of notable exceptions.\n\n0 icon cards were pulled.\n\nThat’s right, 0 icon cards were pulled.\n\nThe “top 9” rare gold cards, rated 91-94 (Cristiano Ronaldo), were pulled exactly 0 times. That’s right! 0 times.\n\nBy comparing the distribution of pulled rare gold cards in terms of their rating, it was evident that cards are not drawn “randomly” from the category “rare gold cards”, but are skewed towards less valuable ones. About 10% of rare gold cards in FUT are rated 85-89, and about 1% of rare gold cards are rated 90 or more, but only 1.6% and 0.02% of packed players were from these rating brackets, respectively. \n\nAs a curious example, I compared the three famous players I’m aware of that also have younger brothers who are slightly less famous but still have rare gold cards: Romelu/Jordan Lukaku, Paul/Florentin Pogba and Eden/Thorgan Hazard. The famous brothers were packed, in total, once (Romelu Lukaku, no surprises there), whereas the less famous younger brothers were packed 14 times in total (3, 6 and 5 times, respectively).\n\nI also calculated the \"return to player\" (RTP) from the packs, as a measure of what was typically returned per spent fifa coin. I did this by totalling the value, according to futbin, of every card in a pack, and dividing this by EA’s asking price for the pack. So, a pack containing cards worth 50.000 coins, and with a cost of 100.000 coins, has an RTP of .50 (or 50%), whereas a pack with cards worth 200.000, and with a cost of 100.000, has an RTP of 2.0 (or 200%). \n\nAcross the 651 opened packs, the average RTP was .58, or 58%. However this average is slightly skewed by a couple of rare instances where packs contained something very valuable. A better indication of what could typically be expected from packs is probably the median (or middle) RTP, which was 38.9% (e.g. 38900 from a pack sold for 100000).\n\nOK, this is already long, so I’ll stop here for now. Here’s a link to the complete dataset. You can use it freely, but please credit me (Rune Mentzoni, University of Bergen, National center for gaming and gambling research). I do, however, reserve the right to publish academically on these data - so don’t steal my paper in preparation 😉 I’m sharing the data because I feel this is information that is relevant today, but less so whenever the manuscript preparation + peer review process is done with.\n\nFor any journalists or youtubers who want to do anything with this stuff, feel free! I’m also available for comments or answering questions - I’ll respond to as much as I can.\n\nAnd here’s a link to the data:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R12Nlw5m5GwBaYH1IPpJl_3QYSO4oV3vH0Lry5DonBg/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n\nEdit: The term return of investment (ROI) was inaccurately used and a bit misleading. Thanks to u/saruptunburlan2 for pointing this out. Replaced it with the term \"return to player\" (RTP), defined as percentage returned to player per spent coin. \n\nAlso, CRISTIANO, not Christiano. Thanks to whoever pointed that out too :)",

            "description": "**Intro:**  \n\nHey everyone, so I wanted to make a guide on skill moves. I could never be bothered learning them but one day I decided to go into a couple of beginner squad battle games and spent hours learning all of the skill moves. After that I tried them out in rival games ( I experimented in rivals after I finished my 30 game limit), I lost about 10 games in a row, just messing around and learning the mechanics of skills.\n\n*I know YouTube will probably teach you more than I can explain, but this is my personal opinion on which skill moves are the best. Note that also using these skill moves regularly in rivals, has taken me from Div 8 all the way to Div 4, and I'm just about to hit Div 3. In saying this though, you definitely do not need all of these skill moves to reach Div 1, these are here for you to learn if you want to become unpredictable with your gameplay and just have fun.*\n\n**Preface:**  \n\nThe very first thing I did was make a list of all the available skill moves in this game. Then I started doing them one by one over and over until I was able to pull them off consistently. In total its taken me a solid week to memorize all of the skill moves and perform them flawlessly in all of my rivals games now.\n\n*At first, looking at the skill moves list is confusing, because the game is assuming your player is facing upwards (i.e. the direction when you're in the practice arena). So if you actually try to perform that skill move during a regular game it wont work, because 9 times out of 10, your player isn't facing upward. He is facing either left or right (depending on which way your team is attacking).*\n\n**PLEASE NOTE THAT I'M ASSUMING YOUR PLAYER IS FACING RIGHT - SO YOUR TEAM IS ATTACKING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT (FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE). SO ALL INPUTS WILL ONLY WORK IF YOUR PLAYER IS FACING RIGHT. IF YOUR PLAYER IS FACING LEFT THEN YOU SIMPLY REVERSE THE COMMANDS OF THE SKILL MOVE.**  \n\n**Example:**  \n\n**Heel to Heel (facing right) flick R stick right then left.**  \n\n**Heel to Heel (facing left) flick R stick left then right.**\n\n*So now I will explain which skill moves are the most efficient to learn \\*my personal opinion\\* and how to execute them. If I haven't mentioned a skill move then that means it's not worth learning because it is outclassed by the skill moves I have mentioned here.*\n\nLegend:  \n\nL = Left Stick \n \nR = Right Stick  \n\nCW = Clockwise  \n\nACW = Anti-clockwise  \n\n6 to 9, 12 to 3 etc. = referring to the numbers on a clock to help describe the direction of R stick skill moves\n\n**1 Star Skill Moves:**\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|The Bridge|Double Tap R1|Double Tap RB|\n\nGenerally you're going to use this skill move whilst sprinting. The best time to use this is if you notice a defender is catching up to you and you need a small pace boost to get around him. I found this to be most effective with players who have high acceleration stats.\n\n**2 Star Skill Moves:**\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Feint Forward and Turn|Flick R left twice|Flick R left twice|\n\nThis move is pretty underrated, I honestly haven't seen many people use it. Instead of using fake shot stop all the time, use this move once a while. If you're sprinting toward goal and a defender is about to intercept you, use this move and your player will stop on the spot and turn 180 degrees quickly with the ball at your feet still. You will now be facing your own goal.  \n\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Ball Roll (let go of sprint button first)|Hold R either down or up for half a second|Hold R either down or up for half a second|\n\nA simple yet effective move which everyone uses. Useful for getting around players who are blocking your passing lanes or avoiding a sliding tackle if timed correctly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Drag Back|Hold L1 + R1 same time then flick L in direction you desire|Hold LB + RB same time then flick L in direction you desire|\n\nAnnoying to defend against, but fun to use. Although not as broken as in FIFA 20, this skill move is especially useful when you're in the box and you need to make space for a clear shot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3 Star Skill Moves:**\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Heel to Heel|Flick R right then left|Flick R right then left|\n\nThe heel to heel is great for creating space while keeping the ball close to your feet. I generally use this move when I have space and I am not near any of my opponents players.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Roulette Left|Move R from 9 to 6 (ACW)|Move R from 9 to 6 (ACW)|\n|Roulette Right|Move R from 9 to 12 (CW)|Move R from 9 to 12 (CW)|\n\nThe roulette has always been a solid skill move for me. It's effective because normally you are running in a straight line then once you execute the roulette you slightly change direction and have a good chance to beat a defender who is rushing at you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Heel Chop Left (while running)|Hold L2 then press Square and X same time whilst holding L up|Hold LT then press X and A same time whilst holding L up|\n|Heel Chop Right (while running)|Hold L2 then press Square and X same time whilst holding L down|Hold LT then press X and A same time whilst holding L down|\n\nThis is another underrated move. The heel chop works like a fake shot stop, but better. As you are running toward the goals, using the heel chop at the right time can get you into space whilst beating a defender who is rushing at you. Don't recommend using this on a player who is jockeying you though because they will intercept you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4 Star Skill Moves:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Simple Rainbow|Flick R left then right|Flick R left then right|\n\nThe Rainbow Flick is still pretty effective this year in my opinion. However you're going to want to use this move on short defenders and only if they are close to you. Don't use it when you have space because you will flick it right into the opponents feet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Spin Left|Hold R1 then move R from 9 to 6 (ACW)|Hold RB then move R from 9 to 6 (ACW)|\n|Spin Right|Hold R1 then move R from 9 to 12 (CW)|Hold RB then move R from 9 to 12 (CW)|\n\nThis is a variation of the 3 star skill Roulette. It is slightly better because the start up time for it is quicker than a normal Roulette and is performed faster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Stop and Turn Left (berba spin)|Flick R right then up|Flick R right then up|\n|Stop and Turn Right (berba spin)|Flick R right then down|Flick R right then down|\n\nThe berba spin is good for baiting defenders who are chasing you in a straight line trying to intercept you. This move is effective because you stop running and turn into space with a great chance of beating the defender. Make sure that the defender isn't too close to you when you try to perform this move because you will get tackled and lose the ball.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Fake Pass (while standing only)|Hold R2 then press square and x same time|Hold RT then press X and A same time|\n\nNot many people use this move, however it's really good to use when you are trying to pass to a team mate but the opponent has a defender in between the passing lane. If you use the fake pass it will trick the defender (sometimes they will lunge trying to intercept) and then you can turn in another direction to look for a different pass. Essentially, the fake pass is useful for buying yourself a bit more time and keeping possession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Drag to Heel|hold L1, flick R left then up or flick left then down|hold LB, flick R left then up or flick left then down|\n\nA new skill move introduced to FIFA 21. This is essentially a quicker and better drag back and you should execute this move when you are sprinting toward the defender, because you want them to lunge at you so you have an easier chance of beating them with this skill move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Lane Change Left (la croqueta)|hold L1, hold R up for half a second|hold LB, hold R up for half a second|\n|Lange Change Right (la croqueta)|hold L1, hold R down for half a second|hold LB, hold R down for  half a second|\n\nA popular move that I've seen many people use. Basically this is a fancier version of a ball roll and is efficient at changing lanes. Use just as a defender is about to tackle you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Three Touch Roulette Left|hold L2, flick R left then up|hold LT, flick R left then up|\n|Three Touch Roulette Right|hold L2, flick R left then down|hold LT, flick R left then down|\n\nAn unpopular move, however it's one that I think should be used more often. Another variation of the original roulette. The difference is, when you perform this skill move, your player moves the ball back toward your goal and you are now facing the opposite direction. It's useful if you can't get through an opponents player and need to make space for yourself again so you can have another chance at scoring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Flair Roulette Left|hold L1, move R from 9 to 6 (ACW)|hold LB, move R from 9 to 6 (ACW)|\n|Flair Roulette Right|hold L1, move R from 9 to 12 (CW)|hold LB, move R from 9 to 12 (CW)|\n\nAnother variation of the original Roulette. Essentially it is the same thing, it's just performed a bit quicker than a normal Roulette and looks very cool. This is a \"hidden\" skill move - meaning it's not on the skill page in the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Drag Back Spin Left (McGeady Spin)|Flick R left then up|Flick R left then  up|\n|Drag Back Spin Right (McGeady Spin)|Flick R left then down|Flick R left then down|\n\nI slightly prefer using this more than compared to the berba spin. It has the same function as the berba spin however your player execute this skill move faster and the ball is at your feet the whole time. Although it doesn't open up space for you as well as the berba spin does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Scoop Turn (while standing)|Square or Circle then press X and move L any direction|X or B then press A and move L any direction|\n\nA very versatile skill move that can be used practically in any situation. Good for opening up space, or trying to get through a defender who is marking you tightly. Using the scoop turn in the opponents box is highly recommended because they will try tackle you, and most of the time you will get the penalty for it because they will clip the heels of your players feet.\n\n  \n**5 Star Skill Moves:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Elastico|Move R from 6 to 9 (CW)|Move R from 6 to 9 (CW)|\n|Reverse Elastico|Move R from 12 to 9 (ACW)|Move R from 12 to 9 (ACW)|\n|Elastico Alternative|Hold R1, flick R left then down or left then up|Hold RB, flick R left then down or left then up|\n\nEveryone knows how broken the Elastico is, because it is so simple to use and is very effective at getting around defenders. I believe this skill move is a MUST have. The Elastico Alternative is actually a \"hidden\" skill move. It pretty much has the same function as a heel chop, but offers your player a slight speed boost and opens up space for you depending in which direction you want to go in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Elastico Chop Left|Hold R1, Move R from 6 to 9 (CW)|Hold RB, Move R from 6 to 9 (CW)|\n|Elastico Chop Right|Hold R1, Move R from 12 to 9 (ACW)|Hold RB, Move R from 12to 9 (ACW)|\n\nSame function as the Elastico except this one looks fancier and has a slightly better chance of tricking your opponents. However, it is slightly slower than a normal Elastico.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Heel Flick Turn|Hold R1, flick R right then left|Hold RB, flick R right then left|\n\nThis is a variation of the heel to heel (3 star skill move). Basically, your player does a normal heel to heel but after that he quickly shifts the ball to the left. Note that though your player will always shift the ball to the left and not to the right. This move is effective to use when defenders are close to you and you are just on the edge of their box.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sombrero Flick (while standing only)|flick R right twice then left once|flick R right twice then left once|\n\nOne of the most consistent skill moves that has been scoring me a lot of goals lately. This skill move flicks the ball over your opponents head and gives you a clear shot on goal. It's best to use this when you have just received a pass from one of your midfielders and you have possession of the ball with your striker whilst facing toward your own goal. There will most likely be a defender marking you, so use this to flick the ball over him, then your player will turn 180 degrees and attempt the volley inside the box.   \n(Note: if you are facing toward your own goal, then that means you are facing right to left so the input for this skill move would be \"flick R left twice then right once\").\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Ball Roll Fake Turn|hold L2, flick R right then up or right then down|hold LT, flick R right then up or right then down|\n\nThe Ball Roll Fake Turn has the same concept as a fake shot stop but it's very effective in baiting defenders to tackle you because the animation looks like you are trying to get around them, however you are just stopping on the spot and keeping possession for a couple more seconds. This gives you time to figure out where you want to pass the ball next.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Spin Flick Left (Bolasie Flick)|Hold R1, flick R right then up|Hold RB, flick R right then up|\n|Spin Flick Right (Bolasie Flick)|Hold R1, flick R right then down|Hold RB, flick R right then down|\n\nThis move isn't as effective as the other 5 star skill moves mentioned here but still works great in the right situation. I normally use this move when I have no space left to run and am getting closed in by my opponents defenders. Your player will flick the ball into the air and go towards the opposite direction of where your opponents players are. It doesn't necessarily get around defenders but it does give you a bit of breathing space to figure out your next move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Flick Over (Okocha's Sombrero Flick)|Hold L1, hold R right for half a second|Hold LB, hold R right for half a second|\n\nAnother very successful skill move that has been scoring me a lot of goals. It's very easy to perform and is essentially a simplified Sombrero Flick. Best to use this on the edge of the opponents box so you can chip the defender then have a shot right after. If you perform this skill move whilst sprinting then the ball flick will be even higher and take a longer time to reach the ground.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Rabona Fake (make sure you let go of sprint button first)|Hold L2 then press Square and X same time whilst holding L left|Hold LT then press X and A same time whilst holding L left|\n\nIf you have a 5 star skiller, you're going to want to use this move instead of a fake shot stop. A Rabona Fake has the same fundamentals as a fake shot stop but is performed quicker and is more likely to trick your opponent because of its animation. It's also very useful for chaining skill moves which I will discuss in a little bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n| Fancy Drag Back Fake Shot|Hold L2 then press Square and Circle same time whilst holding L right|Hold LT then press X and B same time whilst holding L right|\n\nGenerally you're going to use this skill move whilst sprinting down the line. It doesn't really get past defenders but you can use it a couple of times in quick succession towards an opponent who is jockeying you. Sometimes it will trick them and they will commit to a tackle which will then give you a bit more space to run past them and hopefully be through on goal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lastly, the hardest skill move to pull off consistently: (5 stars also)**\n\n|Skill Name|PS4|Xbox|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Drag Back Fake (while standing)|Hold L1+R1, move L from 6 to 12 (CW), then 12 to 9 (ACW) quickly|Hold LB+RB, move L from 6 to 12 (CW), then 12 to 9 (ACW) quickly|\n\nFirstly, this is a hidden skill move and was quite difficult to learn (for me anyway). I gained inspiration to use this skill move from watching Tekkz play in his FUT champs games. Once you are able to perform this skill move consistently though, it's just a great feeling. This skill move is very effective at tricking players and giving you that space needed to go through on goal. You're going to want to use this move only in the opponents box because generally it gives you the space needed to score a goal. It works well with chaining skill moves which I will talk about now.  \n\n\n**Chaining Skill Moves:**  \n\nIf you've read this far then I'm assuming this guide was somewhat useful, so thank you!  \nHere I will list some skill moves that work nice together when you chain them (i.e. performing one skill move right after another).  \nHowever, it's recommended to chain skill moves only when you are an expert at the required skill move needed to do so. When you chain skill moves you become even more unpredictable and will have a better chance at beating defenders.\n\n **1. Feint Forward and Turn -> Sombrero Flick (5 stars needed)**  \n\nUsing Feint Forward and Turn makes your player turn 180 degrees and face your own goal which is then a perfect opportunity to use the Sombrero Flick to get over a defender who is marking you.\n\n**2.  Fake Pass -> Any Roulette Variation (4 stars needed)**  \n\nUse fake pass to trick a nearby opponent who is marking you then roulette away immediately to give yourself space and have more passing lanes open.\n\n**3. Rabona Fake -> Drag Back Fake -> Any Elastico Variation (5 stars needed)**  \n\nIf you're about to reach the opponents box but need to stop quickly because defenders are catching up to you, use the Rabona Fake to give yourself space then quickly do the Drag Back Fake to trick opponents and then you'll move from the current spot you're standing on with any type of Elastico to be through on goal.\n\n**4. Heel Chop -> Simple Rainbow (4 stars needed)**  \n\nThe Heel Chop is effective at beating defenders who lunge at you because you change direction when you use the skill move. You can then use the Rainbow Flick right after if you need to beat another defender but want to keep the momentum of your player without having to stop.\n\n**5. Ball Roll -> Heel to Heel (3 stars needed)**  \n\nAn easier combo to pull off and can be used anywhere on the field. Mostly good for opening up passing lanes then getting a small boost of pace into an area where there are no defenders. Avoid using if there is heavy pressure on your players.\n\n*Obviously there are so many combos out there and different combos work for different people depending on how they play the game. But these are my top 5 skill chain combos that work for me in most of my games.*\n\n**My Team and Extra Info:**  \n\nIn case you were wondering here is my team I'm using at the moment. It's nothing special and everyone can afford it easily. I have plenty of coins to upgrade but don't want to because I'm having heaps of fun. As you can see I have 4 players with 5 star skill moves then Di Maria comes on as a sub which offers me another 5 star skill moves. I change to a 4-1-2-1-2 wide formation in game.\n\n[100k Team](https://preview.redd.it/ezb99x6lzyw51.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93dcd9942f09a30fb036a1fc39b84ac10ddd9ab1)\n\nI've come across many different teams as we all do in this game. I've beaten people who had Mbappe, Neymar, Varane, Mendy etc. in their teams but I've also lost to people who had 180 rated squads. So your team is only as good as how you play and how effectively you can utilize the players in your squad.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\nI hope this guide has helped people who want to learn how to do skill moves properly. Let me know if you agree/disagree with my list and what your opinion on skill moves is. End of the day, don't worry too much about the meta, because this is the first time in a while I've had fun playing FIFA. Win or lose I genuinely enjoy 99% of the games I play.",

            "description": "Hi all,\n\nSome of you may remember me as the guy that posted formation guides and gameplay tutorials through the years; though most of you likely won't. My posts have gathered tens of thousands of upvotes, and proved extremely popular, and I'd like to think, brought some fun to FIFA.\n\nLittle bit about me: I am a 41 year old Boomer, who regularly achieved Elite 1, and even once T100. I'm no expert, far from it, but I do alright. If I can make T100 (once, but let me brag), with the reflexes of a sloth, you young shit-bags certainly can. I took a year off of FIFA last year to focus on study, and, well, because the El Tornado/La Croqueta spam in 19' frustrated me to the point I honestly lost faith in 20'. Saying that, FIFA is like an unhealthy drug - and here I am, back again, to throw out some content for the FIFA fiends to feast upon.\n\nI don't follow meta, (fuck I hate that word), tactics - rather, I look to exploit people who blindly follow others. My guides are never what you would call *normal*. \n\nI do not play the same as others, and my guides typically reflect that. I play aggressive attacking football, (think Keven Keegan's Newcastle, old timers), aiming to out-gun my opponents. If you prefer to hold on to the ball all game, passing pointlessly trying to pad irrelevant possession % numbers, well, maybe this guide might not be for you. I couldn't think of anything worse than to play a video game like that. But hey, to each their own.\n\nI'm starting this year off with my second most favourite and reliable formation, (behind my 4222, which a guide is to come shortly...), and that's the 41212 narrow. I've thrown 100 or so games into it already in D1, and it's proven very successful for me; even against those boring players that have 70% possession and 2 shots on goal, (2x sweats across the face of goal), over the course of 90 minutes.\n\nI will be posting a series of tutorials, starting firstly with the formations, then moving on to gameplay guides; such as manual defending, attacking patterns, and effective skill moves. I'm holding off on gameplay guides, as I need to get a handle on things and a better understanding of 21's mechanics first. The formations I will most likely be posting a guide on, (depending on their viability for me), will be: 41212(2), 4222, 3421, and lastly 433(5). I mean, I could post 4231 and 442, (though I rarely use those, and frankly, find them a bit boring). There's plenty of guides out there for those, anyway. Yawn. \n\nRight, enough bullshit dribble from me, let's get to the guide and explanations behind my decisions:\n\n** By the way, my formatting sucks and always has done on Reddit. But hopefully it's legible enough.\n\n**41212(2)**\n\n**INTRO:**\n\nThis guide will be broken down into Four sections with an explanation for each section. The Four sections will be: Playstyle, Custom Tactics, Player Instructions, and Player Types.\n\n**PLAY STYLE:**\n\nI play this formation very aggressively, with a very high tempo, and attempt to win the ball back as high up the pitch as possible to relentlessly throw an attacking onslaught at my opponent. I like to force my opponents into making mistakes and out of their comfort zone. Possession players hate me, as they piss around for 30 minutes creating naff all, and when I get a hold of the ball - Bam, goal. This game's a bit messed up in the way that the longer you hold on to the ball, the more your AI decides to push your team up, opening you up to a counter. It's always been like this; regardless of instructions and tactics. I look to exploit this by soaking up pressure and keeping my shape, then counter attacking with speed. I won't lie, typically, I finish with something like 40-45% of the ball - but that's fine, as I also typically have 2-3x my opponents attempts on goal. I'll take that any day of the week.\n\n**CUSTOM TACTICS**\n\n**Defense**\n\nDefensive style: Press after Possession Loss\n\nWidth: 6\n\nDepth: 6-7 depending on pace of your CB's. \n\nI play press after possession loss, as like I mentioned earlier, I like to play hyper aggressively aiming to win the ball back as high up the pitch as possible to relentlessly attack my opponents. I feel that press after possession loss, this year, barely affects your players stamina; and since we're playing a narrow formation with players fairly close to each other, it doesn't drag your players into weird spaces leaving open areas - as you usually have another player close by to cover.\n\nI have width at 6, for reasons you will see later, when I go into player instructions. \n\nI have depth at 6-7, also, for reasons you will see later when I go into player instructions. \n\n**Offense**\n\nOffensive style: Fast Build Up\n\nWidth: 5\n\nPlayers in Box: 6\n\nCorners: Personal Preference. I use 2.\n\nFree Kicks: Personal Preference. I use 1.\n\nFast build up, for me, is the key to 41212(2). As you will see when you get to my player instructions, I set up my team to counter attack with pace and to exploit high possession players or players parking the bus. Remember what I said about how if people hold on to the ball for an eternity their players AI naturally brings their players forward? This is how you exploit those park the bus gimps or high possession players. You could also try Long Ball. But I prefer Fast Build Up for narrow formations, and Long Ball for wide formations, as I feel like you need wide players to best utilise Long Ball.\n\nI use width of 5, as, well, whatever. I don't notice much difference in this formation when I mess around with it, unless I go to extreme width which kinda defeats the purpose of this formation.\n\nI set players in the box to 6, as I feel like it involves my CAM and attacking CM more in the attack when my full backs push on. You will see what I mean when I discuss instructions for the CM's. There is an argument for lowering this, though, and I do need to test that a little more. Reasoning behind potentially lowering it, is that blocked shots seem super prevalent in 21'. By not having so many players in the box, your opponents AI won't track your players runs into the box, and as such, won't crowd the area.\n\nCorners and free kicks, do whatever you want on this. I don't score too much from  corners, as I don't have the personnel for it, so I set it low to try to stop my opponents counters. I usually play it short, also, as I find my opponents score more from my own corners than I do.\n\n\n\n**PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS**\n\nThis is where it gets fun and my 41212(2) differs from the other 41212(2)'s!\n\n**If no instruction is stated, it is because I am using default.\n\n**LB/RB:**\n\n-- Balanced, Overlap, Conservative Interceptions.\n\nOur full backs are a key part of our attacking play. They provide the necessary width to drag our opponents defenders and CDM's out wide, and force our opponent to manually defend to track runs, which is exactly what we want. We don't want our opponent packing the box and just running around with his CDM while his AI does all the work. That shit's too easy for him.\n\nI put them on Balanced, rather than Join The Attack, as I feel that JTA makes them play like wingers and they are way too far forward. We still want them to actually defend when our opponent is attacking, yet, we want them to assist us when we go forward and address this formations main weakness - width.\n\nI use Overlap as I want them to pretty much hug the side-lines as much as possible. Inverted gets them into shooting positions, and frankly, full backs are generally pretty terrible at putting the ball in the net.\n\nI use conservative interceptions to help to preserve as much STA as possible, and also for them to retain their shape.\n\n**CB**\n\n-- Don't touch these. Default across the board.\n\n**CDM**\n\n-- Stay back while attacking, Cover Center.\n\nNot much to stay here. We don't want him going forward.\n\n**CM**\n\n2 sets of instructions here. One for your most attacking, and one for your CM that acts as a center back. You will see what I mean in a second.\n\n*Attacking CM*\n\n-- Get Forward, get in to the box for crosses, Cover Wing\n\nYou obviously want a CM that attacks well here, or a Striker/Cam with decent STA in this role. He is going to be bombing forward and making late runs in to the box. In many instances, he ends up having the most shots in your team, and quite frequently bangs the most goals. Very dangerous player, as he often isn't tracked by the AI very well.\n\n*Defensive CM*\n\n-- Drop Between Defenders, Cover Center\n\nWhen we are attacking, our full backs will be pushing forward. What this dude does when you're attacking, is move into a CB role while your CB shifts over and covers your full backs position. It turns into a 3-5 ATB formations, rather than leaving two exposed CB's while your fullbacks are causing havoc up the other end. Also, for some reason in FIFA 21, your defenders are awful at tracking fast through balls on counters. They literally part like the red sea. Having a third CB makes this infinitely harder for your opponent to do that as he clogs the middle up between your natural CB's.\n\nYou want a CM here that defends well, and is quite pacey if possible. Keep in mind, that when your opponent is attacking for a sustained period, he will move out of a CB position and back into midfield. He only drops back between the defenders when you are attacking. We are effectively playing with a normal CDM, and a super deep CDM just sitting on top of the defenders. I use my actual CDM in this role, and my defensive minded CM in the proper CDM role. \n\nConfusing, I know. \n\nAs an example, say you have Fabinho and Wijnaldum. I'd put Fabinho into the CM role with \"Drop Between Defenders\", and Wijnaldum as the CDM. This means, when attacking, Fabinho becomes your 3rd CB and Winjnaldum chills as the CDM on stay back instructions; providing you additional defensive support while your other CM bombs forward. I hope that makes sense.\n\n**CAM**\n\n-- Stay Forward\n\nI just use Stay Forward here, as you want him as an outlet when winning the ball back for counter attacking. If he drops back defending, you will struggle to counter attack effectively. Also, supposedly, Stay Forward negates the bug where your CAM swaps positions with your midfielder randomly. I dunno about that one. I don't get it too often.\n\n**ST**\n\n-- Get in Behind\n\nI just use get in behind here, to abuse the fact that through balls are so deadly in 21. I don't use stay forward as I need them as passing options when coming back up the pitch as one of my CM is told to drop between defenders, making me a bit lighter in the middle of the pitch.\n\n\n\n**PERSONNEL**\n\nThere's obviously tons more than I suggest, but you will get the idea from the archetypes I suggest.\n\n**Full backs:**\n\nThe dream - Mendy, Robertson, Alexander Arnold. \n\nAlternatively - Any full back with decent Pace and STA. Good passing is also quite important.\n\n**CB's**\n\nBest you can afford/link up with\n\n**CDM**\n\nThe dream - Kante, Allan, Nainggolan\n\nAlternatively - Any little bastard that can run around really fast and harry your opponents. You don't want a man-mountain type here, you want that player in the CM role that acts as a CB.\n\n**CM**\n\n*Attacking CM*\n\nThe Dream - Bruno Fernandes, KDB, Griezmann\n\nAlternatively - Any decent striker or CAM with ok'ish defensive stats, but high STA and good finishing/attack positioning.\n\n*Defensive CM*\n\nThe Dream - Fabinho, Casemiro, Zakaria\n\nAlternatively - Any big fucker that can also act as a CB. Try to grab one as mobile as possible as he's gonna be doing some running.\n\n**CAM**\n\nGood passing and shooting is a must, here. Best WF you can afford. Pace not so much, as he feeds the ball to your strikers and releases them anyway. It's nice to have, but not absolutely necessary.\n\nThe Dream - KDB, Messi, Havertz.\n\nAlternatively - Best you can afford that fits the archetype I described above.\n\n**ST**\n\nTypically, I always went one big striker and a smaller, more agile one to feed off. This year, with through balls being as good as they are, I use two rapid strikers that can cause havoc with pace.\n\nThe Dream - Werner, 7 chem Mane, Dybala\n\nAlternatively - Rodrigo, Inaki Williams, etc. There's tons of this type floating around.\n\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nAs I said earlier, this is the first of many guides that I will post throughout the life of 21.\n\nI've found this formation very strong this year, as 2 striker formations seem to work well because the AI CB's are acting like mongs.\n\nIf you're looking for a base-line as you've just got the game, I hope you give this a go and it brings you some joy. I will be answering questions in comments, but please refrain from do you think player X works here, as I've outlined that in the player types, and I've not had a chance to try nearly all of the players yet.\n\nIf you do try the formation, let me know how it works for you, and any adjustments you might have made. I don't profess it to be perfect - it's still very much a work in progress -  and will evolve as the game gets patched, and the players released become better.\n\n\n**[EDIT]**\n\nAdding a FAQ somewhat, since I'm being messaged a lot.\n\n*Why don't you just use the regular CDM to drop back and the CM to Stay back while attacking?*\n\nI want both of them in the middle of the pitch. If you use your CDM on Drop between defenders, and your other CM as stay back while attacking, he will stay back while attacking on the right/left side of the pitch, not the middle.\n\nBy doing what I have done, you have your CDM in the middle, as well as the drop between defenders CM. I originally did it that way, but through testing, I prefer doing it this way.\n\n*Why isn't my Drop between Defenders, doing his job and dropping between defenders?*\n\nHe will only drop between defenders when you have the ball, and are attacking. Other than that, he will revert back to a regular CM positioning. Your fullbacks will also revert to their defensive position, when your opponent has the ball, making it a back 4. If you lose the ball immediately after gaining possession, you will sometimes have a back 5 for a brief moment. Other than that, he reverts\n\n*Your formation is the definition of meta!*\n\nMeta shifts depending on rank, ELO, location, time of day, etc. Where I am playing, at high D1, counter attacking with full backs bombing on is definitely not the meta. It might be at your rank? I don't know. What I do know, is that through watching other guides, reading shit etc. I've yet to see anyone utilise the 41212(2) like I am, with drop between defenders and get forward on your CM's turning them into quasi CB's and 3rd Strikers.\n\n*I'm conceding so many goals, this sucks! I'm getting countered all the time!*\n\nWell, yeah, you *ARE* going to concede more. I mentioned this at the beginning, but, you will also create a hell of a lot more. We sacrifice defensive stability for a much better and potent attacking experience. You will also get counter attacked, especially against wide formations.\n\nI'm quite strong defensively, personally, and often, I will have games that end 5-3, 4-2 etc. It's just the way it is. This aggressive style really punishes player that are worse/equal with you, while competes heavily with those better than you - depending on how they deal with it. People want the perfect formation, strategy, tactics etc. that is super powerful defensively and attacking-wise. Well, in my experience, there really isn't one, aside from an ultra-boring 4231 defensive/counter set up. If you wanna play that way, go ahead. There's a reason why it's so popular. It lowers skill gaps and lets you nick wins you against better players. I don't like playing that way.\n\n*Are these players good for this role? How should I set up my team?*\n\nI don't know. I only know my own players. I'm not going to advise on something I have no clue about. Just try them based on the archetype I suggested. I'm sure all different kinds of players work.\n\n**[EDIT 2]**\n\nThank you all for the kind words, awards, etc. I'm glad you're enjoying the formation and it's working for you! For those it isn't working for, oh well, maybe it's just not your style.",

That being said, this tactics set up actually is entirely meta so far this year. Aggressive pressing, fast build up or long ball, narrow formation, low possession, everyone bombing up the pitch...speaks to about 50% of my experiences in D1 after maybe 60 matches. I think the reason its so effective right now is because 1. People are struggling to defend properly and 2. There are some genuinely broken aspects of defending, such as how Varane can sag 5 yards off Mbappe and still get smoked for pace when the through ball comes in.\n\nAll that being said, my point is that while these tactics are definitely effective in general, and extremely effective at this point in 21, I have a feeling some people will be sorely disappointed when the game gets patched to shit and ruins these tactics.",

If this isn't encouraging kids to spend their parents cash, or adults spending they rent/mortgage payments then I don't know what is. \n\nEA please for the love of God, put a daily/weekly/monthly FIFA point limit, stuff like this will ruin people's lives and its all for some pixels on a goddam screen, stop exploiting people, it's absolutely disgusting.\n\nWhat do yall think?

            "description": "I turned 18 a few months ago; one of the things that most new-adults never have to worry about is getting brain surgery. A method I used in order to take my mind off of the inevitable life changing procedure I would have to go through, was playing FIFA. As I lie on my bed, hallucinating on painkillers and drifting in and out of consciousness, all I can and want to do is play FIFA.\n\nMy life has made a complete 180, with me turning 18, feeling as much of an adult as I ever have, to an almost toddler-state, where I’m dependent on assistance with everyday things like opening a bottle to getting dressed.\n\nI’ve been through a lot these past few weeks. I’ve cried for the first time in years in front of my parents. \n\nLogging onto FIFA, everyday, looking at all the new content, really brings a much needed smile to my face. Playing squad battles with fun teams and players like Emiliano Sala and red Papu Gomez makes me happy, even if I can only play on professional so I won’t hurt myself haha. \n\nOpening Bronze packs takes my mind off of everything going on, whilst getting me a few coins closer to the next SBC I want to complete or player I want. \n\nAs sad as I am right now, playing the game we all love to hate, and hate to say we love, has really made my awful experience a lot less awful. I’ve had so little to appreciate as of late, so playing this game just to try and find some fun in life has brought the fun back into this game. \n\nNext time you think this game is shit, or how unlucky your pack luck is, it could always be worse. Life doesn’t guarantee you anything, but that shouldn’t stop you from seeing the good in things, even if it’s something as small as FIFA. \n\n(Apologies if this post is all over the place, I’m high as hell on all of my meds haha)\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the kind words! You guys make me smile with every comment I get. Really appreciate it!",

Back in 2006, I played semi pro football and was on verge of becoming professional but tragedy struck.  My leg got stuck in-between two people from the opposite team sliding for the ball and umm I broke my ankle, it was twisted around quite badly.  An ambulance was called whilst I laid on the muddy cold pitch and my team mate putting their coats over me to keep me warm.  I remember the ambulance journey, I felt every bump on the ground, it was agony.  Next thing I remember, I wake up with a cast on my leg laying in a hospital bed.  Would I ever kick a ball again is all I ever though about, it was something I loved doing and had a lot of passion for.  I had to learn to walk again after 4 months in a cast.  I've never had been a gamer before that.  Whilst I was at home recovering, my sister bought me a ps2 with fifa.  She knew what football meant to me and though it would help.  I started playing the game and although it wasn't the same thing as running up and down a pitch on a cold rainy night, it was still something that kept my passion alive.\n\n12 years on and I still play fifa every single day, it has helped the ease of not turning professional since I can no longer run as I used to, and kicking a ball just hurts the ankle too much after a while.\n\nI absolutely love fifa, just hate the mechanics of the game though.",

They took a deep dive into my transaction history and said it may have been because I was too active in the transfer market, even though I told them I typically only bought bronze packs on my phone app during my commute. \n\nShe mentioned several players I had bought and sold, including common players and specifically some 49s and 72s (if I remember correctly). She said there didn’t appear to be anything suspicious, other than buying a player and listing them in the same minute. \n\nShe looked at my login history and said someone had tried to access it from a different country but they they were unable to log in since I had the two-step verification. \n\nShe is escalating the complaint back to the account team, although she doesn’t have a timeframe since it’s a different department. I also asked her a couple times if she could email me my transaction record and she said at the end of the call she would do that after the call has ended.\n\n\n**\n\nLast Wednesday, EA emailed me to say I had broke their terms of service by coin selling/buying/distributing.\n\nI knew I had done nothing wrong so I emailed them to tell them exactly what I had done on my account in the past day or two and to ask them to review the transaction logs.\n\nToday, eight days later, they emailed back to say they had reviewed my account and determined their original decision was correct. They still didn’t tell me what I supposedly did to get the coins wiped or what I could have done to prevent it. Another user in here said if it happens a second rime (whatever 'it' is) then I'll be permanently banned from the market.\n\nThey never sent me any copy of the transaction log so I still don’t know for certain what triggered it. But if it is as something as dumb as one player buying a handful of my cards totally out of my control then that’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. Do you think that it was because the same account bought some of my cards that I had relisted through the app?\n\nHere’s my email to them.\n\n“I have not done anything that can even remotely be considered in violation of your rules. Over the past week or so, I have typically opened bronze packs, the occasional silver pack and any packs I have earned from Flash SBCs and maybe a League SBC or two. Again, you can check this to see for yourself.\n\nYesterday I bought nine or 10 Eder Militao cards with a shadow chem style already applied. I think I bought them on bid for around 8,300 - 8,500 each. You can verify this. I listed them all up a couple times for about 9,000 bid and 9,800 buy now, since there were not too many on the market and I expected prices to rise a little over the next few days as Weekend League approached. They did not sell after two or three tries, so I lowered the price to around 8,700 bid and 9,300-9,400 buy now. You can also verify this. After my last set of listings, they sold. I think after tax, I probably earned about 500 coins on each card. Everything else I sold over the past couple days would have been primarily smaller value items, with maybe the exception of someone like a Manzukic. You will also be able to verify this with your records.\n\nI have no idea who purchased any of my cards, but it was not planned with anybody and it certain wasn’t from a second account I own. Please take the time to look at IP addresses or usernames and I know you will see this, too.\"\n\nTLDR: I’m salty about this whole thing. Even if you play by their rules, try to make a tiny amount of coins and respectfully ask them to investigate your account, you’re never safe from the EA ban hammer.",

Pro clubs (it would be 11 a side, so no AI players) requires communication, cooperation, coordination, skill, teamwork. NBA 2k does this, and it's much better than FIFA's eSports. Plus it is a lot cooler IMO to be a part of a pro clubs professional team, like being for example Bayern Munich's virtual Starting Goalkeeper than to be one dude with a FUT team.

            "description": "I was just watching Boras' stream from yesterday and am very surprised with who used to be the only popular FIFA streamer I could tolerate.\n\nHe was playing a fairly mediocre first match in draft mode, even giving his opponent an early free goal. He then proceeded to moan the whole match about how he misses 'croqueta cancel' and now finds it impossible to score, while he was sometimes running in circles when there were good passing options available. Still, he managed to create a couple chances where he was honestly unlucky not to score.\n\nBut the epitome came at the very end of the match, in extra time. After some very bad defending from his opponent, Boras finds his left back wide open, running close to the byline, and has three teammates in the box against two defenders.\n\nEasy quick cross or driven pass to benefit from that priceless advantage, right? Well, Boras decided to do a fake shot right on the byline, then proceeded to turn back and give the ball away. The match ends right there (0-1 loss) and he pronounced the magic words: 'I feel there is zero skill gap because the game is so slow'.\n\nHe said that seconds after basically rejecting to create a chance! Probably due to how deeply stuck the pointless tics from recent games are in him. What's even the point of doing a fake shot when there are no defenders right in front?\n\nThe worst thing is that these people and their hordes of fans are going to put huge pressure on EA, and eventually make them ruin a game that looks way closer to real football than it's ever done. All because they only want an accelerated and simplified experience where they can just play by pure muscle memory.\n\nPS: yes, reposting with a small change since it seems like it got autoremoved due to the title",

            "description": "I've seen a lot of people complaining about the matchmaking and a lot of times it comes out that they rage quitted the games where they were losing. For this reason I want to demonstrate you with some facts that if you rage quit the form isn’t decreased.First of all, a bit of background about the matchmaking: the game tries to match us with a similar opponent, in order to do this it use two parameters: matchmaking form and geographic zone ([source](https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/fifa/fifa-ultimate-team-champions/)). We start our weekend league from a form of 0 and we gets +1 for each win and a -1 for each loss. It goes from a minimum of -10 to a maximum of 15. This means that theoretically a 15-0 has the same form of a 27-0 so they could match up. I don’t know if skill points are used to avoid this situation but they aren’t mentioned in the precedent link so I doubt it.\n\nLet’s now suppose that we made a really great start in weekend league and are 15-0 then we get tilted and we rage quit 5 match. For some reason we still get matched with really strong opponents: this is because the matchmaking form wasn’t decreased. To demonstrate this I’ve conducted a little experiment, I’ve used a url that is loaded during the FUT WebApp start up that reports some stats about the current Weekend League. The first photo is right after my 20th victory and like we can see it reports various data, the most important for us is the matchmaking form that is 12 and in addition we have the “tiebreaker” parameter that could probably represent skill points score that we see in the top 200 leaderboard, but I’m not sure about this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I've won this game my winForm has been incremented from 11 to 12\n\n**GAME 28**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2soela0dkog61.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5e1686637b730f61c0e49cd63210e38c137fed4\n\nThe next game I played to loose on purpose and we can see that my form gets a -1 and go to 11.\n\n**GAME 29**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unqem7fgkog61.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=05d669058cd15f9ac58ecc70eec21d2f5a120600\n\nFor the last game I’ve scored an own goal and abandoned the game and we can see that the form doesn’t get decreased.\n\n**GAME 30**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ot6vl8eikog61.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8b6d5d4c271d8f4491cf0b2fd146e3d6b36dc25\n\nThe next game I should have be matched with someone with a form matchmaking of 10 but since I’ve rage quitted the following game I will be matched with an opponent with an 11 form, that could presumably be a stronger opponent then the one I should have match with a 10 form matchmaking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: if you want to get matched with weaker people you should never quit a game in FUT Champions. This is not a myth it’s a fact\n\n**UPDATE**: **In order to answer to whose ask the url, and under suggestion from the moderators, I add the procedure to get the data. Please keep in mind that it is not a standard request and we don't know if EA check it. There is the possibility that the use of this URL could lead to a ban, I don't take any responsibility.**  \nI found this data just modifying the parameters of a request of the WebApp, when it starts it load a url ([https://utas.external.s2.fut.ea.com/ut/game/fifa21/champion/user/hub?scope=nano](https://utas.external.s2.fut.ea.com/ut/game/fifa21/champion/user/hub?scope=nano)) to get the status of the Weekend League prizes. I've simply removed the scope parameter and got the data shown in the pictures. In order to make this work you obviously need to be authenticated, and modify the request using a program like Postman having the correct headers. ",

            "description": "Everyone knows eventually EA is going to have to change their model for UT, likely when the UK and Germany take action against loot boxes. EA knows this too and are preparing people.\n\nWe already have a large part of the community who enjoy building untradeable teams via SBC's, this is something EA is encouraging.\n\nThe next step is for people to accept untradeable rewards without complaining, something everyone complained about at the start of the year but over time people get used to it and accept it as the norm.\n\n\nI'm fairly sure EA will sell players outright to avoid lootbox laws. For example, Neymar could cost 1000 fut tokens. They'll sell these for real money or let you earn them incredibly slowly by playing the game, through sbc's, WL/Div rival rewards. \n\nThis will not only allow them to monetise the big cards everyone wants to use, it'll allow them to monetise what we call 'fodder'. If you want to compete a player SBC that expires in 3 days but don't have the cards for it, you'll buy a 90 rated Ter Stegen to make sure you can complete it before time runs out.\n\n\n\nThis is why they removed Icon SBC's in my opinion. They know how desperate people are for them and they'll reintroduce them in the future and act like they're caring about the community. They'll likely go as far as making these types of SBC's only available for a limited time in order to push people to impulse buy and continue to bring them back every so often. \n\n\n\nPeople will say 'oh i'll quit fifa if they do this'. It doesn't matter to EA if the f2p players quit, this model will change nothing for a p2w player. Infact, it might encourage people to spend more because they don't have to spend so much time opening packs and with no way to trade cards to get a return on them, people will have to buy, buy, buy to continue to upgrade their teams.",

Following content and casting from Day9, Artosis/Tasteless, and TB was what moved me from just casually playing SC2 to going full hardcore and competing in the Collegiate StarLeague. But I think it was when I starting following the \"WTF is...\" series that I took more of an interest in games in general, and that was influenced my eventual career in game development. \n\nWatching him cast SC2, even though he wasn't as knowledgeable as some other casters, I remember thinking to myself that his posh British voice somehow made the competitions more real, made esports more legitimate to me. I'm gonna go watch some of his old StarCraft casts today. RIP TB\n\n",

            "description": "TL;DR: I'm old but Gold.\n\nI've been playing League for over nine years now, and the dream always was to be above average. It's not a big dream, but there you go.\n\nWhen we still had ELO, that meant being above 1200 (I never was). As soon as we had the ranked system, I wanted to be Gold. That's where the shiny borders are. That's where you get skins. That's where you can tell people you're actually kinda decent at this game.\n\nThe problem always was that I suck. My already non-existent mechanical skills managed to deteriorate even further after I hit 40. I also can't play every day, since my family and my job come first. And there's always too much happening on the screen for me to follow. I regularly confuse my own character with one of my teammates. I'm incapable of outplaying anyone.\n\nSo what I do is play braindead champions in the toplane, disable chat, ward as much as possible, bash towers whenever I can, and let the young folk carry me.\n\nThis afternoon it finally happened. I goofed around on Garen a bit while my Draven killed everyone and everything, and at the end of that game I was Gold. I'm absolutely ecstatic, but no one I know plays League. In fact, everyone I know thinks I'm a bit of a twat to still play videogames at my age. But to me this is a big thing.\n\nSo there you go. And I'm pretty sure if I can do this, any one of you can too!",

            "description": "Hey all, \n\nSo I will try to keep this anonymous as possible, though it's quite hard given my current situation. I've been playing League of Legends for 6 years under the alias Squid Corona - squids are my favourite animal and Corona, believe it or not, is my real life surname. \n\nAs I'm sure everyone is well aware, there is a global pandemic called COVID-19 or, as very inconveniently for me, better known as Coronavirus. Trust me, I've heard all the jokes possible from friends and co-workers. \n\nAt the start of 2019 I managed to change my in-game name to just \"Corona\" as I thought the shorter version of my name was nicer, worked well with telling my real life friends to add me on League, as they all know it's my surname and I think Corona is a cool name so why not have just that. I had to use one of those third party sites to check the name and stay up till midnight in order to secure my family name in League (as a side note, Riot should really consider implementing a bot-detect system to stop name sniping).\n\nI'm by most descriptions a casual player - I play one or two games a day of normal draft pick, almost always with friends just as a way of relaxing after work. On the 1st of April, I try to login to be greeted with a message telling me I need to change my name in order to proceed. I thought it was amusing at first, as almost every game a player would say in chat \"nice name\" to me, but I just shrugged my shoulders and emailed Riot in the hopes of them agreeing that it was a funny situation, and my name would be white-listed. \n\nAfter two weeks of back and forth with multiple \"Player Support Specialists\", I was told that they had come to the conclusion that my name would not get white-listed and that I would have to change it if I wanted to keep playing League of Legends. **This is specially stupid since in other regions, players with the name Corona are still active and playing.**\n\nThis to me is all very disappointing. I haven't chosen the name \"Corona\" for any reason, and certainly haven't done it during the covid-19 outbreak. I feel like Riot are just sticking a big middle finger to me and telling me that my family name is inappropriate to be a part of their game. I'm posting this to reddit because I want to know if the community really feels offended by the summoner name \"Corona\", or if I'm right in feeling a mild rage and sense of unfairness.\n\nEDIT: here's proof of communication: https://imgur.com/a/OE9l8sc\nProof of ID has also been privately sent.\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks for the pressure reddit, Riot has given me my account back!",

After a long day on the ranch, I pour myself a tall glass of milk, huff some paint, and log on to the Dell I got for Christmas in 2006 with Windows XP to play some League of Legends.\n\n\nThe client needs to patch. That's fine. I reheat a bowl of beans and lard for supper, and it's already at 13% by the time I get back, well ahead of schedule. I huff some more paint to pass the time, and oh boy does it pass. The client is ready to go by 7:30. Everybody keeps saying it's laggy, but I don't notice any difference from usual. Maybe I'm just too intelligent, or maybe the paint is finally doing its job. \n\n\nI queue up solo - normal blind pick of course. The queue pops, and Clippy asks me if I want help selecting my champion. Not now not ever, I think boastfully at the cartoon paper clip. I lock in Dr. Munro. My teammates pick Shaco and all the others pick hot anime girls. I take one last good long huff to get ready for the game, and in we go.\n\n\nThe first thing I notice is that their team doesn't have a dt Munford. Free win then. I go top lane. I always go top lane. They have a Aatrod. Pathetic. I hit the minions. I miss some crepes bc I have 450 ping. Aatrox tries ro hit me but I heal up bc I'm drMindoro.\n\n\nMidgame I have sunfire and I tp botlane to gank. They have thst new champ Aphelios shootijg weird bubble guns at me. There's a tirret or sometbjng? Idk anuway I kill him by running at his face pressing e amd right clicking him to death. I miss all three cleavers I throw. It doesn't matter.\n\n\n20 min latr a D really stsrting to feel the paint. I have sjnfire warmogd spirit vosage and tp to baroj for teamfigyt. Aphekios knows he's dead as soon as tp channle starts. He tries to get away by rooting me or sokething? Idk anyway I press ult and run him down. I forgot ti buy boots. It doesnt matter.

This you should just play mondarb against aphelios. He kill gun guy good. Thank you. Thank you. If you kill gun man, anime grliss hot. they'll be lower son. The Dr mildew play is right thing to do.

            "description": "https://twitter.com/Biofrostlol/status/1522999710751076352/photo/1\n\n> I'm gay. I've struggled with my personal identity my entire life. While my parents were working in China, I moved around a lot from homestay to homestay, which is basically where you live in a stranger's home. At the age of 8, I was bombarded with homophobic and sexist remarks at home, and whenever I did something that wasn't \"manly,\" I was told, \"Why are you acting like a girl?\" and to stop being \"gay.\" I was hyper-conscious of how I should act and tried not to act or sound \"gay,\" but I was still constantly bullied at school for it. No child should have to feel like they don't belong. Working in the video game industry hasn't helped matters either. On almost every team I've been on, I've heard homophobic comments from either my teammates or the staff and felt uncomfortable, even borderline afraid of possibly losing my job if I told the truth. I'm at a point in my life where I've accepted who I am, and it's taken me a long time to get there. My story is not unique. The gaming industry is rampant with sexism, prejudice, and homophobia. I don't believe there's a quick fix, but it starts with us holding ourselves to a higher standard and treating everyone with dignity. We need to educate people in esports of proper conduct within the workplace. I'm not making this announcement because I owe everyone the details of my personal life, but because I want there to be more awareness about the problems our community faces. Thank you to my parents and friends who have made me feel like I belong. You the real ones.",

            "description": "I was not expecting today to be any different in terms of big life changes, it's really just a Thursday, pandemic seems to be easing up a little... But this morning, as I was playing draft pick, I understood something very painful: It was the last time I would play League of Legends.\n\nI have been experiencing a very sudden process of sight loss due to untreated glaucoma since April 2020 that culminated in me hitting the threshold for legal blindness last December. All throughout the process, I kept playing League, as it was legitimately my favorite game and I had so much fun playing, but the past three months or so have been incredibly taxing, emotionally. I was playing more sporadically because even 15 minutes of straining my eyes leaves me with a migraine, but the more time that went between matches, the more noticeable my sight loss became whenever I logged in and sat for 30 minutes watching my gameplay worsen, the information slowly becoming something I could not parse. It was obviously not just the migraines, but the solidification of the fact that, well, fuck, I am going blind.\n\nI know the community has a reputation for being jaded and toxic, and to an extent, I did get splashes of that experience, but honestly? My experience as a player was overwhelmingly positive. League was something for me to bond over with my real life friends, and a gateway to kind communities where I got to know online friends that would come to matter more to me than words could express. It was rewarding, I could see myself improve with practice, even if I never aimed for a high rank, and sitting down every night to play a few hours was the only thing that kept me going in what have been, quite frankly, a shit couple of years. When I think of League it's never the bad matches that stick with me, it's the neat outplays, the honest conversations about life in voice chat, the delight that came with messing around with builds and meeting people that I had this in common with. \n\nToday was the day the loss finally hit. I was playing a Lux match, and understanding that even with my main, even with the more contrasting skin I could find, and all the color settings adjusted, and a giant monitor with a magnifier could not do anything about the fact that I just could not play because I could not see anything relevant. No abilities, no health bars, no indicators... My lack of peripheral vision also meant that all my attempts at hitting anything were mostly guesswork. Hell, the only reason I knew who I even was playing was the color of the blurry HP bar that took up a quarter of my monitor. \n\nI don't think I can kid myself anymore into thinking that things will remain the same even as this huge part of my life changes into something unknown and terrifying. I hate that League of all things was what made me understand how real and irreversible the sight loss is, but it is what it is. So today, I have decided that I have played my last game of League. I did not savor it. I did not prep a goodbye party, and if this is a goodbye speech then it's kind of shitty.\n\nI would still like to make use of this cheesy word vomit to thank League players and the team behind the game. You've brought many things to my life that I hope will remain now that League is no longer in it, and I am grateful. Regardless of what comes next, I will remember these times in my life fondly, and that's pretty much invaluable.\n\nThank you, it's been great. See you on the flip side.",

            "description": "I was writing a new wiki page about [unit size](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Size) the other day. One of the size modifiers that exists is Baron Buff, which only affects minions, but sure enough, this page was about non-champion sizes, too.\n\nSo after I set out to determine those modifiers, I also wanted to confirm the attack range increases on the Baron Buff page, which I asked a friend to get me. For the Cannon Minions, he returned '1050/1030 total range'.\n\nI looked at those 2 values the same way you are right now. Nope, this isn't about other minions on any separate map; these are SR cannon minions. The Blue Cannon has 300 attack range; The Red Cannon only has 280 range!\n\nAs it turned out, this has been a bug since the earliest builds of the game we have access to; all the way back from Alpha! Minions are coded as separate units for both sides of the map; So are skins, technically, albeit they properly draw from the same data file for the gameplay side (the only differences are tags like 'human' and 'freljord' which VO interactions use). Same types of minions...do not draw from the same file. Not a big problem, though, as they only have to get a few values right? Yes, in theory, that isn't a big problem.\n\nUnfortunately, in the game right now, [**this** is an excerpt the Blue Cannon Minion data file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/334447591372619778/736725095849918484/unknown.png), and [this is the same excerpt in the data for the Red Cannon minion](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/334447591372619778/736722781516857444/unknown.png). apart from the Name ID's, notice a difference?\n\nAnd indeed, in the game, these minions adhere to those range values. \n\n[If you make 2 opposing cannons run into each other without interference, they'll not always start attacking each other at the same time like same-ranged units would](see \\*Edit below for why this link is missing) - instead the Blue Minion goes first a lot of times. The reason it doesn't happen always is that 'is my enemy in attack range yet' is checked only so often, which is also why attacking an enemy moves your champion slightly closer than their attack range would require most of the time. Some would argue that that is to aid in chasing/orb-walking, but I don't think it was set up with that in mind. In any case, attack pathfinding at least doesn't path you into Dragon pit if you want to attack someone on the other side of that wall that is in range of Dragon pit at the time, which would be dumb.\n\n###Edit: I got some help in re-doing the proof for this:\n\nUsing Syndra W, we can get exact range values and eliminate the *'is my enemy in attack range yet' check* by throwing the minion straight from inside its range to slightly further than it was before. If it attacks without walking, it's inside its attack range; If it nudges forward first, it was thrown further than it's attack range.\n\n[Test with Blue Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KGli9vl6LA) | [Test with Red Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spxwe27i6P4)\n\nHere is a [comparison for the longest throw at which the minion doesn't nudge forward (= is still in attack range) at.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737305947759837324/unknown.png) The difference isn't large (it's about 5% of attack range against a normal-sized champion), but you can see it [via the cursor location.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737307018922295387/unknown.png)\n\n-\n\nAlso, [there's a Ryze bug that made separating these minions kinda annoying yet kind of fun.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmgKH_Aadps) This is the reason you canot port a single Rift Herald, or a single minion period, btw (first minion takes last ported champion's position, or won't get a new location at all if no champion was ported).\n\n-\n\nI tried showing off this difference in the one patch where the new HUD showed unit ranges in the collapsed version (5.14), [however minions all show as 0-ranged anyway due to ((bug))](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737283877122343043/unknown.png). Which is sad, maybe someone would have noticed it then already!\n\n-\n\nThe fact that blue team seems to generally win when the game is left alone by players entirely might be due to this bug. Blue team also has a higher winrate overall in the game, which is often attributed to the assymetry in HUD and the map, which is reasonable, but I wonder what the impact of this bug has been on that winrate, afterall.\n\n-\n\n\\*Edit: Turns out the mentioned tickrates make this way too hard, and upon reviewing the best clip I have, it has minion damage increase due to my target dummies leveling up, so ~~I'll remake this for you with a proof that's less up-to chance.~~\n\nEdit2: Remade proof. Now definitive. See above.\n\n---\n\n**TL:DR**: [Spot the difference](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549266844964618242/737282716000714802/Cannon_Minion_data.gif)\n\n---\n\nEdit: Would you believe it, turns out this bug is LITERALLY fixed on PBE this cycle already. I did all this confirmation work for naught. Well, at least we know the fix will be in 10.16 (next full patch), most likely!",

I did not understand why he couldn't just stop mid-game when I needed him to. I did not understand his love of esports. We were drifting apart.\n\nSo, I asked him to teach me how to play.\n\nTo say that it was a steep learning curve is an understatement. But I kept at it because I loved him. The more I understood about the game, the closer we got. After some disastrous games on Summoner's Rift (where I was rightly flamed for not knowing how to ping), I switched to just playing ARAM because it forced me to learn what all champions do. It was also more chill.\n\nWhile I was never very good and never tried playing ranked, I understood enough to enjoy watching the LCK, MSI and Worlds. In 2019, my son and I travelled to Taiwan together to watch both of the semifinals of MSI. It is a memory that I will always cherish.\n\nNow that he has grown up and left home, I don't play anymore but I am so grateful that I made the effort to understand the game he loved. Definitely worth.",

During this match there were four players who paired as two duos, popped into each other (now they control both teams ff's). By the time anybody realized what was happening, the duos were farmed enough to 2v3. So whenever a team went to end, they would communicate to their friends on the enemy team and prevent a team from ending the game. \n\nI've learned that this is something they've planned and executed before: https://twitter.com/mordeeasy2getlp/status/936469118097571840\n\nand that Riot actually encountered this game and didn't look into any possibility of collusion. In fact, they arguably celebrated this here: https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2017/11/ask-riot-longest-game-ever/\n\nHere's their youtube upload of the prior colluded game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahxwlzP0FX0\n\nI just have no idea what i'meant to do against such organized and dedicated griefing. I can't submit a ticket, i'll just get told to report them in post-game and they do the usual nothing about a ticketed complaint. So I need to get to end screen to report them. Oh btw, the client has bugged on end screen and i'm stuck at \"skip waiting for stats\" so now I can't even report them.",

            "description": "The only way to solve toxicity in SoloQ is with more sexually aggressive skins. \n&nbsp;\n\nThink about it. What causes toxicity in Soloq? Toxicity exists because players play the game. However, by having more sexually aggressive skins/champions. By limiting the hands require to play the game to one the toxicity would be reduced literally to 50%. That one toxic player in your team? His toxicity now are reduced to 50%. He call your mom fat? He now calls you mom. \n&nbsp;\n\n#But We already have some and that didn't help\nPool party Taric, Armor of the fifth age Taric, Ahri, Pajama Urgot, Rek Sai, etc. They are all great skins/champions but there is a greater demand than the supply. Everyone has their \"playstyle\" and not all their \"playstyle\" is being fulfilled. So more skins/champions would make players happier. \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's compare real numbers. Not counting PBE let's say toxicity level in Fiddlestick Rework Patch is 10. Right now the toxicity level is 0 on Voibear Rework patch(10.11) as of today. You can even say no one is playing on that patch except Riot Client Programers. This is why I think Fiddlestick should have been reworked to a Waifu that hugs you when he ults and not this little scared farmer's son hiding in the jungle. \n\n#Real Science behind it\n Freud the father of Psychology says that libido, our sexual desire, drives our every action. Libido has a broader meaning than just sexual desire but it doesn't fit my narrative so I am going to ignore it. Right now League player's libido are not being fulfilled so they try to release it in ways that could be harmful to people around them and themselves. \n &nbsp;\n\n#Top Lane\nTop lane has been recognized as one of the worst roles to play but there is a reason people still play them. If you ask any top laners why they **really** play top lane they would say \"I just want to see two big dudes smashing each other.\" This is why people play top. People pick Jax so they can see and feel Jax use his big and necessary large rod against Malphite who is literally just a big bulge. However, this is not enough for some players. When they play jax they imagine themself as Jax smashing Malphite but when they realize they are the one being smashed their mental collapse. Their libido went unfulfilled so they tried to smash anything that is close by which is in many cases their junglers. They smashed Jungler via their chat and well that is how toxicity start. \n&nbsp;\n\nBut if Jax or even Malphite has a attractive skin Jax wouldn't need to chat or int to fulfill his libido. He could simply zoom in on his character which he is already doing it anyway. He could just play his best and accept he can't be on top every game and sometimes he have to be bottom. This combine with 50% of hand usage elimination would eliminate toxicity on Top lane. \n#ADC\nADC players are masochists. They like being slaved around by their random braindead partner. They like comparing their suffering to other ADC and enjoy the rush of freedom when eventually their shackle are set free. That high when 0/10 Jinx reached 4 items and is no longer a ranged minion is something no any role can reach. But now that even when you reach 4 items that high is no longer guaranteed. 30 minutes of buildup just to be instantly killed off by a 0/2/99 mid laner. Where does that energy go? That energy that has been built up for the last 30 minutes? Into the chat it goes. \n&nbsp;\n\nPeople start picking Mages bot not because they are stronger or something(lol) but because they have better skins. Ahri, Vlad, Ziggs, Syndra all have very attractive skins and only MF could really compete against them. Which is probably why MF has one of the highest pick rate and win rate. \n#Mid/Jungle/Support\nNO one cares about those roles. They don't do anything in game anyway so there is no need to talk about them. Right now games are decided by Top and ADC. Mid/Jungle/Support has no agency whatsoever compare to Top/ADC so there is no point talking about them. \n#It's time for more Kaisa Skin\nVoibear Rework is a step in the right direction. This would fulfill people with questionable desires and hopefully stop them from going outside. Many people libido are being unfulfilled and by giving them champions and skin that matched their disgusting desire they would be happier. Don't ask which demographic they made Yuumi for. For F2P player the Honor System could reward them with skins which would prompt them to think libido in long term and reward holding it in. Streamers should also be encouraged to equipped those skins so the viewers could learn that that is a way to release their libido. I don't think it is right to witch hunt streamers that don't equip those skins since everyone has their own \"preference\" and you never know what the context is. Unless obviously if they play Taric without Pool Party or Gem of the fifth age skin but even then just report them and don't personally attack them.\n&nbsp;\n\n#What I am trying to say is: It is time to pull out Pool Part Urgot.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Potential Question:\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Why does NA have this problem and not Korea?\n&nbsp;\n\nA: Cause NA doesn't have Kpop and not having Kpop stars ruling your country is a big disadvantage culturally. Everyone there is playing League to please their Kpop King/Queen so victory is the way they fulfill their libido. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n2. How about the little blue mens ruining my games??\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA: Those blue men are typically called smurfs and they are actually pro player/coaches trying to scout that Gold 4 Brand that solo killed Faker years ago. Unfortunately, the scout is unsuccessful but still ongoing and now it is almost a part of the game. Just try your best and maybe you can fool them that you are the brand player and get in LCS. Just remember that they are scouting because they are not at Faker's level so just laugh at them desperately trying to scout Faker killer in Iron 2 and being hardstuck at LCS. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n3. What should I do when other player tries to fulfill their libido on me?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA: If you are into it you can enter their role play but just don't become the problem trying to solve the problem. Let's say your step-sister is stuck in the bathroom and needs your help. Don't go in and get stuck yourselves. Call the fire department because accidents in the bathroom are dangerous and can break some bones if you are not careful. Sometime the fire department comes too late or never comes. In that case, you should simply lock the door and cover your ear to prevent your sister's dying cry from traumatizing you. Know that even Saints like Voyboy are unsuccessful in helping others get unstuck. Don't get yourself stuck trying to help others because now your stepmom has to come help and it just keeps ongoing. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n4. Voyboy, Press B to be Dominated/Dominate, Morellono Merchant/Dirty Mono Blue Player, Germ, T1 the Redeemed/Unredeemed,Blue man TF, DoubleSwitcherino, the guy that made me question my sexuality, Mega iGNAR, Best NA Jungler's friend: Santorin\n&nbsp;\n\n\nA: just name dropping some random names since apparently Reddit loves to name drop when it is irrelevant to the discussion.",

Her hat is a legendary magic-resistant item known as the Adoptive Helm.\n\nEssentially, this is a VGU that changes Zigg's character model to Kleeg's. The same is done for all his/her skins. Her abilities and stats are exactly the same as Ziggs, but since she's an anime girl, she will sell many skins and will be forced to be meta.\n\nAlthough Ziggs will no longer be in the game, he'll live on as a character in the lore, until he dies a tragic death to further Kleeg's character development.

Some way or another I bring up that I am platinum ranked in League. \n\nShe just kinda laughs, acknowledges how cool and how incredible an achievement that is. We continue chatting, until I need to bio. I am about to get into the bathroom, except I forgot my phone--and in my gut there's a fat, fat storm brewing. \n\nLo and behold, I get back to the table and my date is furiously looking through her phone. Wait--it's *my* phone. She had memorized my passcode!\n\n\"What the hell?!\" I ask, pulling my phone away. Her grip is like a vice. On the screen is some kind of LoL statistics page!\n\n\"I just wanted to see your thick match history,\" she pleaded. \"Oh god, look at all that green, oh my lord I can't believe it.\"\n\nWherever I go, my amazing platinum rank follows me like a stench. Men, women, anyone: if they hear that I have extreme skill and a diverse champion pool, they only see me as some gamer Adonis. \n\nSometimes I'll be taken home, thinking it's past-time to get funny. But then my would-be lover shows me to a computer and begs me on their hands and knees to let them witness \"one short ARAM.\" Is that all I am? A set of fingers, a pair of eyeballs, blessed and cursed to be so much better than you at this game?\n\nMy main, my main is Teemo.

            "description": "If Riot acknowledges jungle as a proper role and a part of how the game is meant to be played then the summoner spell Smite shouldn't be restricted.\n\nAnd also since flash is \"mandatory\" on basically every champ, why is that not the spell they are given with heal at lvl 1, so that they can learn how the game is suppose to be played? Instead they play heal and ghost and then once they learn the game they go \"Oh, hey, I actually have to take this summoner that I have never used before on every champion.\n\nYou could also argue that this is a smurf-only issue but I've seen tens of thousands of players complaining that they would like to begin the game as jungler, and maybe if they could be a jungler earlier on, there would be better junglers in the lower level and elos. Saying this is a smurf-only problem is blind hate coming from someone who had bad experiences with smurfs, I mean, have you ever asked the new players if they would like to jungle? But obviously there's also a need for a jungle tutorial. ",

            "description": "This is not a sarcastic post. My girlfriend started playing league, and she loved the idea of playing jungler when I explained it to her. Warwick has been perfectly designed for a new player and a new jungler.\n\nThe q and his passive keep him on great health while jungling at all stages in the game. He can solo dragon and Rift herald easily (she LOVES getting all 4 dragons). His blood trail let’s her know when someone on the map is low, so she knows that she may have an opportunity to gank.\n\nI’m a diamond jungle main, and I’ve pretty much never played Warwick, but watching and teaching her how to play it really gave me a huge appreciation for that champions design. I’d have to say it’s one of the most successful reworks ever done in the game.\n\n\n**\n\nedit: Here are the answers some of the most common questions I've had on the thread...\n\n**How do you have a girlfriend and get to diamond**:  Got to diamond first, the girlfriend comes shorty after.\n\n**How did you get your girlfriend to play League**: She always heard me playing and having a great time, so eventually she wanted to learn.  We actually played that old Miniclip game Motherload together a lot when we started dating so she 'gets' gaming.\n\n**Can I watch your girlfriend**: If you mean watch her play league.... yes! I am not allowed to post my twitch account on reddit however\n\nBonus edit: u/IcePokeTwoSoon created a nice post on why WW is good for new players, with a challenger guide attached.

Using Q when low for big heals, or really getting the most out of E's damage reduction for outplays. The ultimate scaling off MS for some clutch snipes...  \nI really feel Warwick was a monstrously successful rework, and his power is slept on. A great jungler for most ELOs, until his kitability begins to limit him.",

Mostly because they heavily limited his ideas because they wanted Warwick to be a very approachable and beginner-friendly champ -- and not get 30 different insane passives and executes and dashes and true damage and stealth. Which, you know. Is probably why he turned out so well on release and hasn't been problematic since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The bugs are kinda annoying still, though. And if you're colorblind like me you pretty much need to buy an epic skin to see the blood trail effects because colorblind mode doesn't alter it.*",

But now we’re getting these weird “interviews” with the characters, and it’s just getting more and more cringey to me.\n\n[Take this Akali one for example. ](https://youtu.be/j1RjqonnU7M) Using a different voice actress than both the singer or her in game character, she sounds like a 13 year old trying to sound cool. The animation on all of these is getting worse and worse, she looks like an animated Ps2 character. I legitimately think they are using some form of the face-tracking webcam software that just places a 3D character over someone else, that’s how bad it looks.\n\nAnd don’t get me started with the [poorly photoshopped people using hand drawn KDA heads](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt731acb42bb3d1659/blta8d515531d8ce728/5f600414d70e764f3292008b/MBAR_014_Akali003_16x9.jpg?quality=90). And yes, this is from the official KDA website, not fan made. I can’t see how that was approved by anyone to post, it looks so bad. I really thought all of the videos and posts I have been seeing were fan made, but nope, Riot is responsible for them.\n\nI liked KDA and what it started out as, and I still do to an extent, but this just seems super desperate to appeal to a younger audience and it’s comical to me.\n\nEdit: Saying “this isn’t made for you, it’s for KDA fans” doesn’t even apply, because I said I liked KDA right out the gate. It’s the poorly made videos and promos that are bothersome, not because of what it is, but because it looks so rushed and thrown together last second for a cash grab that it’s almost insulting to people who legitimately enjoyed it. As a KDA fan I AM THE INTENDED AUDIENCE and what is being made SUCKS.",

            "description": "It honestly surprises me that Riot is going with the route of making even more champions. I mean, I always wondered how far League would go when it comes to its roster, after all, more than 150 characters in a single game is a hell lot, and it seems like its going in the direction of becoming way too much.\n\nI know that stopping new releases is extremely unlikely and hell, I'm not really saying Riot should straight up stop releasing new champions for a while, but reworks have always been an excellent to introduce content that was, realistically, new, while also updating stuff that is outdated, and considering we're having a poll to pick one of five champions, why not simply rework like three of them and get rid of three new champion releases?\n\nHaving less new champions would also have the effect of making the ones getting released more memorable. Now, the pandemic probably contributed to the issue, but it felt like some champions were thrown in the game without ceremony: Lillia, Samira and Rell were particularly overshadowed by the champions released close to them, Lillia could not compete with the hype around Yasuo's brother, most people were talking about Seraphine when Samira was released, and Rell stood in the shadow of the Ruined King. Keep in mind I'm not saying those champions are bad or that I hate them, but they weren't given much time in the spotlight because of other champions that received much more attention even before they were officially announced.\n\nAlso, its not like Riot needs to go too far with VGUs, Ezreal is one example of a VGU that only changed one ability, but because the champion is popular, the update to his appearence and voicelines was hyped enough. We have some ugly-looking popular champions like Ahri and Lux, whose voicelines don't fit their story anymore, as well as some champions that could use only minor tweaks on their kits in addition to new appearences. Of course, we should have big VGUs (fingers crossed for Udyr to win the poll), but not all champions need gigantic changes.\n\nAn issue that is usually brought up when this topic shows up is the fact that new champions usually make more money. I cannot confirm nor deny this, because I don't have any sources, but I really wonder if all of them make that much money. Because here is the thing, I don't doubt some of them made a lot of money, Sett had a prestige skin, Yone would sell simply because he is Yasuo's brother and Seraphine was released with a lot of hype and an Ultimate skin with one of the most popular themes in the game, but did the others really make an ammount of money that, say, a reworked champion wouldn't make with their remade skins? What if champions that get reworked get one new skin too if that is the issue?\n\nAgain, I don't have the number to argue here, but I honestly don't think champions that get overshadowed are selling so much to justify the choice of inflating the ammount of champions in the roster. Besides, even if we assume that there is a loss of money, I don't think Riot would be hurt by gaining slightly less than the millions they make every year in exchange for improving the old stuff that will benefit the game in the long run. Specially because, if the number of champions start growing uncontrollably, it could reach a state that is much harder to manage.\n\nI know this topic has been brought before, but honestly, if the community keeps bringing it up, maybe its something that could be looked into, many people aren't content with the number of new releases and how it cost us potential VGUs. An excess of releases doesn't seem like a good idea in the long run.\n\n**EDIT:** This is a late edit (12 days), but it is relevant. Riot Reav3 has dispelled the myth that new champions make more money than VGUs and commented on why they don't do more of those. [Here is what he said:](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/lbohdz/only_one_league_vgu_will_be_released_this_year/glwvmhq/)\n\n> I'm not sure where this perception that Champs make so much more then VGUs came from. Some VGUS have made more money then new champs,(especially ones with big skin catalogs that get updated with the VGU) some niche champs make much less then the base line VGU makes. Also, after we VGU a champ we can still make skins for it, just like a new champ. At the end of the day it doesn't matter though. The Champions Team is part of the Gameplay initiative at Riot, whos main goal is engagement not revenue. Skins in general make waaaay more then any new champion ever makes, and it's not really a goal for the Champions team to make revenue. Our main goal is engagement, which is to say we want to make products that keep people playing LoL. One of the reasons we toned down VGUs was that we saw data that showed that whenever we do a VGU some amount of players quite the game completely, usually mains of the champ that don't like the rework. If we do A LOT of VGUs in a year like we did in the past, we actually start actively going against the main goal of champs team which is engagement since we would see less engagement with the game as a result of many players quitting due to the VGUs. Actually a couple years back when we did a lot of VGUS (and the class updates) we saw in player surveys at the time a pretty big upswing in players upset that we were changing way to much, way to fast that season. This has since come down a lot since we cut class updates and reduced VGUs. Now like I have mentioned in the past, we still want to do VGUs as we believe in the longevity of LoL and part of that is making sure the game feels modern and up to date, which means updating old champs that don't feel that way, but I dont think just saying \"all players want vgu's\" is a accurate statement, at least not according to real data we have from player surveys.\n\nNow, this certainly explains why they don't do more big VGUs, and it is a good reason, people leaving the game due to the changes to their mains is something that we know happens (even though I, personally, would never leave over that), and, like I said before, the whole \"new champions make more money\" excuse (because we know now that it is an excuse) didn't make any sense. However, this does not explain why they don't do smaller updates like Ezreal, who only needed a small kit change and got a new model and voicelines. They could still do this, because, since the kit would be mostly the same, people would not leave over that and would actually have their main looking better and having more to say.",

They’re a highly-expressive and diverse bunch that’ll function as your avatar in Teamfight Tactics and cheer you on in ARAMs.*\n\nOnly few days ago they announced the removal of Little Legends from ARAM due to visual clarity issues which can be found here: [QUICK LOL THOUGHTS: JUNE 19](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/news/dev/quick-lol-thoughts-june-19/)\n\n---\n\nSo what does it mean for us ARAM players who bought Little Legends in intention to use them in ARAM?\n\nThere is nothing we can currently do, there will be refunds but only in one condition:\n\n*Refunds will be applied to accounts that own LLs but have never played TFT. It doesn't look at specific LL usage, it's an account-level \"TFT yes/no\" flag.*\n\nAnd just to confirm i contacted Riot Support and explained my situation and this what they said: https://i.imgur.com/pkRy7CJ.png\n\n---\n\nNow let's be fair, most of us who play ARAM played TFT at least once when it first came out, it was Riot first game beside League and it was a big deal back then. The way Riot is currently handling the case is like a smack in the face, they're removing a feature from the game that you paid for and only been out for a year. I've never been a fan of TFT, i only played it for the Pass missions which includes emotes, Eggs and icons. I don't know what else to say, i think this requirement is ridiculous and i've never seen Riot treat their customers like this before. They said **''almost no one has purchased them for ARAM specifically''** which mean it's not the end of the world if they refunded a small numbers of players who play mostly ARAM who love having their Pokemon **Hushtail** following them around.\n\n---\n\n####**Update: June 23, 2020 @ 18:35 PM (CEST)**\n\n[Riot Meddler Tweeted](https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler/status/1275467514021961728)\t\n\n*Update on LLs and ARAM - we're putting any changes on hold for now. Based off your feedback we agree our current approach isn't hitting the mark. Will reassess and get back to you folks with an alternative or modified approach for further discussion.*",

I imagine almost every player tried at least one game of TFT when it first launched, but I haven't touched it since Season 1.  I also only have Little Legends from Twitch Prime, so it's not a huge pain in my ass, but it's a bad restriction.",

Pro players should not be queue'ing up anymore and facing each other in high elo and should rather wait a couple of months until the new season starts ?\n\nI think this reflects the mindset of some people working on riot games, we have a problem ? oh let's take it easy it doesnt matter anyway we are in preseason...",

I remember the Runes Reforged preseason, a bunch of champions/runes were way too strong, a bunch were way too weak, there were problems, we actively  worked to try to fix them\n* Seems like the same is going on here. I went and played with the new items, overall I like the direction, but my boy yasuo seems weak with the crit changes. I trust they'll adjust things though\n* Now, I could just be a Riot shill (I am), but back when I was on League this was the busiest time of year. I was grinding both in the months up to preseason and especially during preseason (when all the juicy data and feedback was coming in)\n* I don't believe the LoL dev team is just \"taking it easy\" rn.\n* I think Riot Support probably intended to say LP gains/losses don't matter as much since it's more about your MMR when you're playing ranked before season start.\n* wintrading is still NOT okay\n\nAnyways those are my takes. Hope you're all doing well, and happy holidays :)",

Tyler1 gave General Sniper a platform and hyped him up every time he interviewed. He obviously cares about the kid and only wants the best for him.\n\n2. When Tarzaned was a bit tilted about Yassuo saying he’s going to leak photos of Tarzaned pooping in his pants, Tyler1 basically said I’ve pooped in my pants so who cares? He basically deflected the situation.\nEdit 1: [Claim on Yassuo](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/750041344?t=11634s) (Starts 3:14:00)\n\n3. When Tarzaned and Duoking both didn’t want Voyboy as the substitute mid for their team, Tyler1 was clearly upset and stood up for one of his closest friends. Also, Tarzaned publicly and privately apologized to Voyboy and all is okay so this isn’t meant to talk poorly about anyone or create drama.\n\n4. Tyler1 is by far the most entertaining streamer and I can tell he tries his best to create a drama free and fun viewer experience because he specifically told Tarzaned to not talk about the drama with Yassuo if Tyler’s chat can hear.\n\nI’m a regular Tyler1 viewer and I’ve always known he was kind deep inside and the kind of toxic behavior is just for entertainment, but I respect him much more after watching his stream during this event.",

At Twitch Con 2019, I had a booth at Artist's Alley, I was super busy and all weekend long and had little time to do anything, even stepping away to eat food was hard, it was exhausting. One of the main things I wanted to do was meet all the streamers I'd done work for over the years because this had been the first Twitch Con I attended.  \n\nTyler was the biggest draw there, the dude had massive lines at his meet and greet and with all the special events he was in, I thought there'd be no way I could make the time to meet up with him and say hi.  His manager who is the person I primarily communicate with when I'm producing art came up to my booth with Mckayla at one point to introduce themselves to me, they were really nice people, we talked about some ideas and right before they left, he told me \"Hey Tyler wants to meet you but he cant get away so come down when you have a free minute.\"\n\nA little later that day I made my way down to his booth, when Tyler saw me walking up he yelled out Zombgief!  And I was able to get a pretty cool bro hug, handshake and take a pic with us holding some of the art I'd done, we bullshitted for a couple seconds but I didn't want to take too much of his time because he had a massive fucking line of people wanting to get autographs and shit. \n\nThe entire weekend several people were coming up to my both with art they got at his booth asking for me to sign it because I was the artist, he had told them to come up and check my shit out.  He didn't have to do that.  On top of that not a single person I talked to about meeting Tyler all weekend had anything to say other than how genuinely sweet he was.\n\nLong story short, League of Legends can bring out the worst in us, and part of streaming as a personality involves creating moments of exaggerated emotion for entertainment purposes.  But I can attest with first hand knowledge, end of the day T1 is a stand up dude.",

But more like cool cakes, because the Hessaire MC37V 3,100 CFM Evaporative Cooler's Removable, washable cooling pad and drain make maintenance easy, meaning that there will never be a moment too hot. \n\nBut you might be wondering, what about the *appeal?* Well, this swamp cooler is far more attractive than over 75% of League's lineup. The champion design team really has missed out by not tapping into that thick chassis, those voluminous caster wheels and Adjustable/Oscillating Louvers that are just savory enough to cause a fella to go into a heatstroke. Except, well... \n\nSwamp coolers are a race of their own. They are like a society, interspersed in Midwest households across the United States, and I think they might even have a few in Europe or something. I am extremely confident that if players could get their hands on the wonderfully effective (and stylish!) pumping mechanisms of a sterling machine like the  essaire MC37V 3,100 CFM Evaporative Cooler, they would throw the past in the bin and swear allegiance to a *real* kind of champ. Close your eyes, and imagine these four splendid words: Swamp Cooler Sneaky Cosplay. \n\nThe background can be varied and detailed, based on the unit's history as a swamp cooler in arduous situations. Perhaps it was forced to become an evaporation cooler in a hazardous Void zone, accidentally taking on some of its corr--oh wait, damn it, the MC37V can be fitted with Aromatherapy/Pest Control fluids to keep such evil at bay. So in truth, it might turn out to be a bit of a Gary Stu, but I want to make love to it so bad. \n\nGod, I love Swamp Coolers. I love their weight, their heft. Just the other day, I had to help lift one into the house... feeling it bore into my arms, leaving bruises in the pits of my elbows as I struggled to hold him... it just made me wish I could log into my FAVORITE videogame League of Legends and just spend a few hours in escapism, pretending I myself have a Utility Top to store drinks, phones, and tools.

            "description": "It has been a controversial week for Riot Games, starting with their first responses to claims of sexism and harassment in offices across the world and ending with their decision to exclude a large portion of their player base from panels at PAX West. These decisions have the League of Legends community, especially posters and commenters on /r/LeagueofLegends, in an uproar. However, Rioters are ignoring the swathes of man-babies on the internet and are doubling down on their proposed solution to end sexism in League of Legends- and the entire world- once and for all.\n\n\"We got the idea to separate queues for men, women, and nonbinary individuals from the positive responses we saw in the community after the PAX decision,\" an anonymous Rioter said in an exclusive interview. \"Women and non-binary people only enjoy a specific set of activities that does not overlap with the activities enjoyed by men, so it was easy for us to make the decision without any sort of discussion or transparency. Today, we're proud to announce we're working to bring similar changes to League of Legends itself- and fighting sexism with sexism is just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nAccording to our sources, the new queue will open alongside the planned ranked changes Riot has in place for the 2019 season, such as positional ranks and a redesigned progression system. To make the queue even safer, Riot has decided to remove all male champions from the pick/ban phase and make them unavailable in the game. We asked Riot employee Daniel Klein to expand on the decision:\n\n\"Well, everyone who isn't a man is obviously scared of men,\" he explained. \"These people are weak, scared babies who can't fend for themselves and cower in fear every time a man is around. I just feel so sorry for them. PAX was our first attempt to save these poor creatures, and I still feel the need to do something more.\"\n\nWhen pressed for details on the queue, Klein offered, \"Well, it's only going to be available until 2:30 PM every day for the first month. We're open to expanding the hours, but you'll have about a billion other opportunities to play. You'll also need to provide a form of identification along with your home address for the queue, which we will of course use to keep you safe and will *not* be passed around to all the bros in the office for a 'hot or not' contest. And now that I think about it, Ezreal is still available too.\" Klein left the interview early after this, insisting his brain had been compromised and he needed to go feed his pet sea lion. \"How dare you exclude me from this interview,\" he said, walking out the door on his own. \"What a joke.\"\n\nUnfortunately, this is all the information publicly available on Riot's man-free ranked variation, tentatively called No-Go Queue. We will update this story as more details become available.",

            "description": "**Rewritten and re-titled to appease mods so it won't get deleted again.**\n\nI wanted to call attention to something that made me really sad about the direction the game is headed and that hasn't really gotten any attention (other than the last post which got deleted very quickly). Recently, a player who has racked up over 2 MILLION MASTERY POINTS playing smite support Singed was told \"I understand you want to play Singed Support, however, your teammates do not want you to play Singed Support\" and was threatened to be permabanned if he did not reform his behavior.\n\nLink here: http://imgur.com/7crNai5\n\nTO CLARIFY: The warning does say that \"picking Singed Support isn't inherently bannable.\" However, the other two reasons given are \"refusing to communicate with team\" and \"refusing to work with team.\" I don't how it can be argued that he is refusing to communicate with his team when he copy pastes a paragraph long explanation of what he is doing into champ select so that his teammates know what he is getting into. There is no explanation of how he is \"refusing to work with team\" other than the fact that he is playing the (admittedly unpopular) role of support Singed. This guy isn't trolling, he is legitimately TRYING to win, and he has a >50% winrate after thousands of games.\n\nIf I see a teammate pick something like Vayne bot, can I report them for \"refusing to work with team\" if they don't pick a different champion just because I hate Vayne bot?\n\nOne more thing to think about: If we weren't allowed to try new things in a competitive environment, how would we ever discover what works? Druiddroid discovered proxy Singed when he was just some random player, NOT a professional. So why do unpopular picks qualify as \"refusing to work with the team\" unless you are high elo? I think this is a disappointing mindset to see in the community, and I feel like there is a significant portion of the playerbase out there that agrees. Why is innovation being stamped out? These people aren't trolls, they are part of what makes league interesting rather than a dull stagnant environment. People are encouraged to \"try new strategies\" during preseason, but then are banned when they actually do?\n\nYou can also find a link to his AMA here: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5cyde6/3_million_mastery_smite_support_singed_ama_and/\n\nEDIT: Added link to ama",

So I played Yasuo, as I always do (mastery level 6, 1 mil points, bronze 1 90 lp), I bought the new item \"Liandries Anguish\" and holy shit it was bonkers. I would kill minions in no time, and the % true damage was too good be to true...\n\nWe obviously won hard as I acquired the liandries anguish at 20 min into the game with about 3 cs/min, only missed 3 cannon minions. \n\nI have to note it was versus 3 afks and their jg was a first time Azir, but still, the items are so unbelievably busted.\n\nI ended the game at 32 min with 80 CS and 2 kills, it was crazy\n\nJust my 2 cents, let me know what you think of them.\n\nEDIT: btw, i'm only mastery 6 cuz i don't wanna waste BE, not because i can't get there, also every silver promo it's my teams fault because they are just objectively worse than me.",

            "description": "I started back in Season 5 (ootay first login screens represent!) after being introduced to the game by a lifelong friend. It seems like a short time ago until you realize it's been 5 years. Over the next year or so, be it through showing other friends the game, meeting people online and more, I came to establish a group of friends who I could always depend to play a game with, almost every single day. Through the steals, the won and lost lanes, the rotating queues, the tilt, and it all, we would always pal up as 5 on a League game (or during then, usually around 4 lol). \n\nLife catches up though, and now when I open the game, I don't see that familiar green circle on their names anymore. Be it responsibilities, moving away from the game or gaming, partners, or just simply moving on, the only green light I see is my own. \n\nI'm sure a lot of folks who have been playing for longer can relate to this lonely feeling.  I miss those memories; they may not have always been good, but at least we were together.",

            "description": "Hi guys, Farza here (creator/programmer of the site). If you end up liking the site, check out my Twitch stream where I’ll be raising money to keep the site’s servers alive. I'm a broke college kid so everything will help! You can find the link on the front page of the site.\n\nEver wonder what kind of music your favorite champion listens to? Welcome to:\n\n[mood.gg](http://mood.gg/)\n\n**What is it?**\n\nMood.gg plays custom playlists for a champion according to a champion’s *theme, personality, and play style*. I always listen to music when playing League and thought it’d be cool to listen to music where it would truly make me “feel” like the champion I was playing. \n\nYou can even download Mood.gg Desktop and control the site using keyboard commands while in game. Read more about that below!\n\nMood.gg already has custom playlists for every single champion in the game. These are the *Main Playlists* and me and some friends worked on them for weeks to make every single one amazing. Go ahead and [search](http://www.mood.gg/lol) for your favorite champ and check out its Main Playlist!\n\nEvery champion also has a *Voting Playlist* where you can vote on songs submitted for that champ submitted by other people. If a song gets enough votes than it is automatically added to the Main Playlist. \n\n**Still don't get it? Here are some examples!**\n\nI think every playlist is really awesome. But some are really fkin cool. Here’s a couple of my favorites!\n\n[Ivern](http://www.mood.gg/choosechamp?championname=Ivern) - Ivern is one of the most relaxing and positive champs in the game. Enjoy his cheerful playlist as you stroll around the Rift. \n\n[Graves](http://www.mood.gg/choosechamp?championname=Graves) - Graves’s playlist is that of a roughed, hardened, cigar smoking, buffed up, hard-core, shotgun wielding, BAD ASS.\n\n[Jhin](http://www.mood.gg/choosechamp?championname=Jhin) - Jhin is a disturbing, meticulous, psychopathic killer and while his actions are horrifying he still considers himself an artist and a man of class. His playlist combines all these things and is… creepy.\n\n[Yasuo](http://www.mood.gg/choosechamp?championname=Yasuo) - Unlike the people that play him, Yasuo has a certain calmness about him and his playlist reflects this solitude and focus. \n\n[Blitzcrank](http://www.mood.gg/choosechamp?championname=Blitzcrank) - BEEP BOOP BOP.\n\n[Jinx](http://www.mood.gg/choosechamp?championname=Jinx) - Psycho. That is all.\n\n[Teemo](http://www.mood.gg/choosechamp?championname=Teemo) - Every single song that was troll, meme-y, or just plain old bad, was put in this playlist. Hope all you filthy Teemo mains enjoy :)\n\nThese are just my favorites go check the other 130 playlists to!\n\n**What is Mood.gg Desktop?**\n\nYou don’t have to download anything to use the actual website. But, I wanted to make the experience of playing League and using mood.gg was as seamless as possible so…\n\nI made Mood.gg Desktop (link to download on website) which allows you to control the music on mood.gg while in game using keyboard shortcuts. This means your game is never disrupted and you never have to minimize the game to change songs or change the volume. For example, if you want to forward to the next song while in game just press Shift + B at the same time . You can even customize these keys to be whatever you want. \n\n\n**How did you pick these songs????**\n\nI made a site called [LeagueMood](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5b5yga/after_a_ton_of_red_bull_and_no_sleep_i_bring_you/) about 6 months ago with the help of two Reddit users named tylertoon2 and aihonen. These two made the original 40 playlists that got LeagueMood going. Be sure to check both of them out on Spotify [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/1266271824) and [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/twinkiey). I started working with them to create playlists for every champ, but we quickly saw that it would take forever. Instead, I released LeagueMood with 40 champs and allowed people to submit songs for other champs as well. \n\nI got 11,000 thousands requests.\n\nSo me, and two of my buddies went through all 11,000 songs, which took weeks, and carefully made a playlist for every champ. I then spent a lot of time programming features like a voting system, a favoriting system, and a desktop app.\n\nIf you guys have any other questions, feel free to ask! Hope you all enjoy the site.\n\n-Farza\n\n",

            "description": "I'm been getting frustrated with seeing all of these streamers \"smurfing for content\", so I built a tool to prove they are not leveling them up on their own. I extended my hobby project to include a smurf-hunter capability that will identify overlap between accounts games to prove account sharing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExample:\n\n    My main account was in game on August 2nd, 3:15pm. The game lasts 35 minutes\n    \n    My \"smurf\" started a bot game to level up on August 2nd, 3:30pm. The game lasts 13 minutes.\n\n**It is not possible for me to have played on both accounts at the same time. Therefore, account sharing has occurred.**\n\nFor big streamers, they seem to be very aware of how obvious this is, so they often get the account leveled up on a different server, or they have someone \"hand-level\" the account many weeks in advance to make this very hard to notice. *Fortunately, with the help of Riot's API and some programming it is very easy to catch these scenarios.*\n\n# Proof in action - TFBlade:\n\nThe biggest offender so far has been TFBlade. Here's the output of my tool when comparing his last 2 smurfs [\"T0P KINGD0M\"](https://twitter.com/tfblade/status/1287923241261174789/photo/1) (screenshot from his twitter) and his current [\"TOP WAVE CONTROL\"](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/705988720) (twitch vod with him on the account):\n\n    [\n        {\n            \"infraction\": [\n                {\n                    \"region\": \"NA1\",\n                    \"startTime\": 1595001493667,\n                    \"gameId\": 3497557968,\n                    \"duration\": \"14.183333333333334 minutes\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3497557968\",\n                    \"startDate\": \"2020-07-17T15:58:13.667Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"region\": \"NA1\",\n                    \"startTime\": 1595002120923,\n                    \"gameId\": 3497597075,\n                    \"duration\": \"28.833333333333332 minutes\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3497597075\",\n                    \"startDate\": \"2020-07-17T16:08:40.923Z\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"infraction\": [\n                {\n                    \"region\": \"NA1\",\n                    \"startTime\": 1595005384635,\n                    \"gameId\": 3497622873,\n                    \"duration\": \"14.166666666666666 minutes\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3497622873\",\n                    \"startDate\": \"2020-07-17T17:03:04.635Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"region\": \"NA1\",\n                    \"startTime\": 1595004515910,\n                    \"gameId\": 3497650230,\n                    \"duration\": \"23.633333333333333 minutes\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3497650230\",\n                    \"startDate\": \"2020-07-17T16:48:35.910Z\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"infraction\": [\n                {\n                    \"region\": \"NA1\",\n                    \"startTime\": 1595001493667,\n                    \"gameId\": 3497557968,\n                    \"duration\": \"14.183333333333334 minutes\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3497557968\",\n                    \"startDate\": \"2020-07-17T15:58:13.667Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"region\": \"NA1\",\n                    \"startTime\": 1595000327484,\n                    \"gameId\": 3497614809,\n                    \"duration\": \"23.1 minutes\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3497614809\",\n                    \"startDate\": \"2020-07-17T15:38:47.484Z\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n\nThere are 3 **infractions** where both accounts were in-game at the same time. Each of the infractions includes links to the offending match histories. This is clear that TFBlade is account-sharing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How does it work?\n\nI look up the accounts via Riot's API, load the account match histories, and then check for any game times on different accounts that started within 1 hour of eachother (potential overlap). If any started within 1 hour of eachother, I fetch more match details and check to see if the game times actually overlap (definite overlap).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The code is public on Github if you're interested](https://github.com/ErikOverflow/LolTrainer-Server/blob/master/services/smurfHunter.js) written in ExpressJS. You can run the server locally if you have Node JS installed by calling \"node ./index.js\" from the project root. The example URL to call for this TF blade example is:\n\n    localhost:5000/api/v1/overlappingGames?region=NA1&summonerNames=T0P KINGD0M,TOP WAVE CONTROL\n\nNote that you would need to register for Riot's developer API and register for your own key. My key is not committed alongside the project, and any keys in the git history have expired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To be clear, I don't expect any outcome from this post. I'm disappointed that smurfing is so common (especially among streamers), but **I'm just sharing something fun I made while learning a new programming language.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit2: Fixed a bug that resulted in some durations not showing on the payload.",

In reality, people sharing multiple accounts / smurfing is the root cause of so many other problems. For example, it exacerbates toxicity and game-ruining behavior because people don’t care if their account gets banned; they can just buy a new one. It also worsens high elo matchmaking and queue times, damages Clash, and encourages others to follow and also smurf.\n\nYou can't really deal with other game-ruining behaviors until you address this issue.  All of Riot's punishments are limited to your account - once people start seeing their accounts as disposable, none of Riot's punishments mean anything.",

            "description": "Hello Car Soccer players, I come here because I want something that I can’t get. Now this is kind of a selfish request in regards to you guys, but I’d give anything for this to happen.\n\nRecently the life of someone I knew was taken too soon. He was my rocket league team mate, and my one of my best friends. He was someone I could always talk to about rocket league or anything going on in my life. In honor of him, I had a long shot request to have an in-game item made for him; just a black flag that says “say less.” It was the phrase he was most known for. Now I tried to create a ticket on the rocket league website, but was told no. Another friend of mine did the same thing, but the response was to come to Reddit. So here I am.\n\nNow the only thing I can hope for is that this post will gain traction and support. If this post actually helps get this item created, I will feel indescribable feelings. And knowing that my friends will be able to equip the flag will mean the world to me. I could die a happy man if the flag is created. \n\nFor anyone who supports this post. Thank you, genuinely thank you. I miss my friend more and more every day, but having an item made in honor of him for his favorite game would mean so much to me.\n\nEdit: I just shared this post with the family, and they are extremely grateful to see all the support and everyone saying “say less.” It’s truly incredible seeing all of this support. Even if it doesn’t happen, I’m just happy that his family was able to see all of the love. Genuinely thank you guys! ❤️",

The game wouldn't be where it is today without our dedicated and amazing community. Today, we're excited to announce that we're gearing up to make that community even bigger. Beginning later this summer, Rocket League is going [**free to play**](https://www.rocketleague.com/free-to-play)! \n\nWhat does this mean for the Rocket League gameplay you know and love? The core gameplay will remain the same, but we are refining the main menus to make exploring the game easier. Plus, we’re revamping and improving major features like Tournaments and Challenges, and introducing cross-platform progression! Rocket League action on the field will still be the same core, high-octane hybrid of sports and action you love today, and soon, even more players will share that love. That begins with Rocket League's release on its newest platform: the Epic Games Store. \n\nRocket League will release on the Epic Games Store on PC the same time it goes free to play. This version of the game will be identical to the version found on other platforms, and will feature cross-platform play anywhere you play Rocket League, including between the Epic Games Store and Steam.\n\nOnce Rocket League goes free to play, anyone who already owns Rocket League on any platform (including Steam) will be able to play and enjoy the game with full support for future updates and features. However, the Steam version will no longer be available to download for new players. To put it simply, wherever you play now (including Steam), you'll still be able to play in the future.\n\nAnyone who has played Rocket League online before the launch of free to play will be rewarded with Legacy status, which includes:\n\n* **All** [**Rocket League-branded DLC**](https://www.rocketleague.com/free-to-play#question-8) **released before free to play**\n* **\"Est. 20XX\" title that displays the first year you played Rocket League**\n* **200+ Common items upgraded to \"Legacy\" quality**\n* **Golden Cosmos Boost**\n* **Dieci-Oro Wheels**\n* **Huntress Player Banner**\n\nIn addition, if you've played online before this announcement, you will also receive the Faded Cosmos Boost.  Legacy rewards will be granted once the free to play version launches later this summer. Check out the items in the slideshow [**on our blog**](http://rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-going-free-to-play-this-summer/)!\n\nYou may be wondering what will happen to the hard-earned inventory that you've unlocked over the years. Don’t worry, it will still be available to you when free to play goes live! Plus we’re introducing cross-platform progression with free to play, and you'll be able to bring items, Rocket Pass progress, and your Competitive Rank to every platform where you play Rocket League, thanks to an Epic Games Account. There's a lot more to share about that, so stay tuned in the coming months.\n\nThere will be plenty more to reveal as we get closer to Rocket League's free to play launch, like new features, content, and the cross-platform progression we mentioned above, so be sure to follow us on [**Twitter**](http://twitter.com/RocketLeague) and visit [**RocketLeague.com**](https://www.rocketleague.com/) for the latest updates. We'd like to thank everyone in our community for your continued support as we approach this milestone, and we're looking forward to introducing our game to a whole new audience!",

Thankyou Derrick from Epic, and Devin. \nAlso a huge thanks to everyone who has upvoted this post, love you all.\n\nJust to make things clear, Epic and steam originally denied me on getting my account re-activated, psyonix at this point had not responded, thankfully Derrick from Epic did manage to come through and save the day. Thanks again to all involved.\n\n———————————————\n\nHi guys...\n\nI’ve been playing rocket league since a few months after release. I’ve gotten every reward, every rank, and tw zombas, tw octane, etc. Basically i’ve invested so much time and money into this game. Throughout my years, i’ve only ever been chat banned for 24 hrs once about 3 years ago. As of yesterday when the update went live, I lost everything. My steam was/is apparently linked to a banned epic games account. I’ve contacted steam,and epic support, both of which denied helping me getting back into the game. I’ve had rocket league far longer than the epic games store itself. I’m not asking for the epic account to be unbanned, i’m simply wanting my steam to be unlinked, or the epic account deleted as i cannot access the account due to it being inactive/locked. \n\nDespite losing items and tags, i’ll be losing my steam friends as 99% of them were through rocket league. I’ll never be able to play rocket league again, despite the fact that i was playing rocket league well before it was bought by epic games. This is just pure nonsense. I’m hoping this post will catch the attention of a psyonix or epic staff member. Please don’t rip away from me my favourite and most played game over the past 5 years... Why can’t you simply ban or unlink my steam account? \n\nThis update has totally ruined me.\n\nEdit: I just want to point out for those not understanding, I cannot log into my epic games account at all, in order to disconnect my steam. Also, i cannot add another epic to my steam as it tells me my steam is already linked. \n\nAlso, I really appreciate the upvotes guys, please look at your DM’s Devin.",

            "description": "Buckle up, it's story time.\n\nThree and a half years ago (October 3rd, 2015, to be exact), I was having a miserable day on Rocket League. Loss after loss on my usual Doubles/Standard play left me in a hopeless state, so I decided to try Solo Duel for the first time, since I figured things couldn't get any worse.\n\nI end up getting matched against a player named onomatopoeia1337, who, after the first two minutes was clobbering me 4-0. With my morale at such a low point, I normally would've left the game. I was in a rare mood however, and decided to stick out the rest of the match...although, rather than playing normally, I decided to goof off by scoring on myself, chasing my opponent’s car rather than the ball, as well as \"turtling\" around the field for fun.\n\nSoon enough, my opponent joined me in my “tactical” game play and we spent the remainder of the match playing around with one another. Once the match ended, I got an in-game message from them saying: \"I like you. Let's team up!\". We then joined forces, winning game after game (which was a nice change of pace for me), until we entered a fateful match.\n\nOne thing I can say is that I never considered myself a \"pro\" at the game by any stretch, and yet in this specific match, it felt like my teammate and I were playing like Grand Champions. The score of the match ended up being somewhere around 8-0 for us, and I was riding a nice Rocket League high. It was then that I received a voice chat invite from one of our opponents. I'm normally not the kind of person to accept invites like this as I don't care much to be verbally berated over a video game, but I genuinely wanted to hear what this person had to say.\n\nI join the chat along with my teammate, only to hear this man go off on us for \"playing unfair\", to \"play him again when we get good\", and other comically unsubstantiated remarks. His frustrations went on for a couple minutes before he stormed off, and I was left alone with my teammate who was giggling in the background. I thought to myself, \"this laugh has got to belong to a girl, or a young boy...\" Now I obviously assumed it was the latter, so I had to ask. Sure enough, I *had* been playing with a girl the entire time. Needless to say, I was surprised. Not only is it rare to find a girl online in this manner, but to find one that was outright better than me at the game? I couldn’t believe it.\n\nWe played a few more matches together while remaining in the voice chat and started to get to know one another. Her name was Sara, a 21-year-old southern girl from Louisiana; I was a 22-year-old Canadian boy from Ontario, and we couldn't possibly have clicked any better than we did. We had the same sense of humor, similar tastes in music, alike personalities, and soon enough we were talking like we’d known each other for years. We made sure to schedule more Rocket League meetups over the next week, and eventually exchanged each other’s information to add each other on social media.\n\nWe began to talk with each other every day over the next few months, becoming more and more inseparable (well, as inseparable as two could be from a couple thousand miles away). There was no doubt that there were strong feelings developing between us, despite the distance. I had only told my sister and a couple friends about the relationship we had, trying to avoid telling my parents about it to save myself from the assumed conversation about me being crazy for falling for a southern girl I met over a video game... Either way, the information had to come out sooner or later, as we were planning to meet each other sometime in the new year.\n\nOn the morning of January 1st, my friends and I were heading back home from a New Year’s party when we were involved in a serious car accident; one that had me put into a medically induced coma. The rest of my friends were relatively okay, thankfully, as my seating behind the driver is what took most of the impact. It was during this time that my friends came out and told the rest of my family and friends about my relationship with Sara, since they knew what we had was real and had to figure out a way to tell her about the terrible news.\n\nI spent two weeks in the coma, and it was still a another few days before I was finally thinking straight. I was greeted by my loved ones who supported me through this difficult time, and it wasn’t long before Sara’s name was being thrown around. To my surprise, my parents were completely okay with the news of our relationship, and they encouraged me to meet her once I was healthy again.\n\nIt wasn’t until I left the hospital at the end of January to enter rehab that I managed to get my phone back so that I could reconnect with her (I was actually expected to be in the hospital for over two months, so I’m convinced that my body kicked it into overdrive just so I could talk to Sara again). The first contact I had with her brought me to tears, and I’m sure it did for her as well. She told me that she felt like she lost a piece of her when she heard the news, and that she prayed every day for my recovery. It was in that moment that I knew that I had to see things through with her.\n\nThrough the arduous year of physical therapy, she stayed by my side (figuratively, of course). I had some physical disabilities that made it difficult to play Rocket League to my usual standard, but it didn’t stop us from continuing our routine “date nights” together. I slowly got my life back on track, and eventually planned a trip in April 2017 to finally meet Sara. I have to give credit to my parents; due to my lingering problems, I was unable to travel by plane, so they offered to drive me down there to meet her while they would go on a vacation of their own (they're awesome, I know).\n\nOn April 22nd, 2017, after a long drive, I finally got to [meet her](https://i.lensdump.com/i/WX1X7o.jpg)…and she was more amazing in person than I could’ve imagined. There was hardly a moment of awkwardness between us, and it was clear that our chemistry was just as strong (if not stronger) in person. We had two wonderful weeks together before we had to part, but it wouldn’t be long before I would see her again. Being a teacher, Sara has summers off, so she was able to fly up north to spend those months up in Canada with me. Following that, since I had another year of college left, I would spend my breaks in Louisiana. All things considered; we’ve been pretty lucky to spend as much time together as we have.\n\nOn one of her many subsequent trips up north, I popped the question. Spoilers: >!she said yes!!< We shared our story with the awesome team at Psyonix after our engagement, and they surprised us with these hilariously clever [player titles](https://i.lensdump.com/i/WcZRIA.jpg)! We've shared our story to many curious players in-game: most of them gave us best wishes and congrats (which always put a smile on our faces), some called us gay (...?), and the rest simply didn't believe us, which we couldn't really blame..\n\nFast forward to today, Sara and I are [married](https://i.lensdump.com/i/WcZ62a.jpg). As a part of our wedding we had this amazing [groom's cake](https://i.lensdump.com/i/WcZCJe.jpg) made for us, topped with some handmade models of our [in-game cars](https://i.lensdump.com/i/WcZtFq.jpg), courtesy of Sara's (very talented) best friend!\n\nThe fact that I managed to find my soulmate over a game of Rocket League is unbelievable. Not only that, but if it weren’t for me goofing off in that Solo match rather than quit, or for her sending me that message to team up afterwards, or for that opponent to send us the angry voice chat invite which got us talking in the first place, we probably never would have spoken to each other. There were so many unlikely factors in play that we truly feel like the stars aligned to bring us together, and it’s all thanks to this game. Sara has turned what should’ve been some of the worst years of my life into the best. We can’t thank Pysonix enough for being a part in bringing the two of us together, and for helping us feel so close to each other from so far away. \n\n[Thanks for reading :)](https://i.lensdump.com/i/WcZJek.jpg)\n\nTL;DR - Got my ass handed to me by some random girl on Rocket League, married her 4 years later.",

So getting a late-night text from my teenager, reading \"RL?\" is really a treat for me. Especially since he didn't play for a long time after initially turning me on to the game. But he's really into it now and we try to play tournaments when possible. - Tonight we had a really toxic teammate. After a while we asked him if he would tone it down and spread the field and rotate with us. My son admittedly wasn't so diplomatic. Our teammate then decided to throw the games after we made it to the semi-finals. I couldn't enjoy our time together, because my kid was barely talking out of frustration. I know this is a boo-hoo post that many probably will downvote and trash me for, but I just ask that people try to be a little more chill and respectful of others. And please don't throw games to 'teach \\[people\\] a lesson'. Especially tournaments. He didn't know, but that really sucked. They say \"One day you and your friends went out to play for the last time and nobody knew it\". Well that's how I regard each session with my son. I'm just down from this. I'll shut up.  ggs. Be nice. Thank you from: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRof3reK/",

            "description": "Hello, my name is Zak and I'm an addict. I'm not really one for talking about myself or the \"here's my story\" kind of person, but today there is something inside me yelling at me to post this. Maybe someone really needs to see this and hopefully it will inspire them to make the leap themselves.\n\n5  years, nearly 2,000 days consecutively, I fell asleep next to a bottle of liquor. The beginning was easy. I was 19 and it was normal in my friend group to party everyday. It wasn't until years later that my problem started to become obvious. My best friends had started graduating college, getting married, having kids, starting their lives. Me? I had a different group of drinking buddies for every bar within a 10 mile radius of my house. I had my day drinking group. I had my \"lets party for 3 days straight\" group. Alcohol was the fuel that sparked every romantic and emotional relationship I had, and the same fuel that inevitably burned them. It was still hard for me to see how bad my problem was. I had surrounded my entire life with people just like me. It seemed normal. I still worked enough to get my rent paid, so I was fine.. right? \n\nAnd then we get to year 5.\n\nThe year the alcohol finally caught up with my body. The year I couldn't get out of bed until hours after I woke up. The year where I could progressively feel my body breaking down more and more each day. I was always hungover. I'd wake up sore, sweating, shaking, head pounding, heart fluttering. It felt as if every second I spent sober was a constant panic attack. It hurt to move. I would try to go a night without drinking, but that would just lead to more anxiety, more heart palpitations and brain fog. All the while the thought \"This can all go away if you drink\" bouncing vigorously around in my cerebellum. Fast forward another month to me waking up late for work, in so much pain that I needed a few shots to even brush my teeth (if i remembered to). Fast forward to my younger sister asking me why I was drunk at 10am at a family breakfast. Fast forward to 6 months straight of drinking all day everyday.\n\nI spend those 6 months feeling absolutely helpless, worthless, and disgusted with myself. It wasn't always easy to keep myself supplied with all of the liquor I needed to get through a day so I had to get creative with how I acquired it. Most days I bought enough to get me through around 30 hours, but when I ran low and it was too late to buy more I simply \"borrowed\" what my roommates had stashed. It was never stealing in my mind. Well- not until I sobered up enough to realize what I'd done. I'd always had intentions of replacing what I drank that wasn't mine. Rarely was I able too. I would often wake up to my roommates yelling and arguing with each other. I've never been shot, but hearing your roommates yelling things like \"He's a thief\", \"Worthless drunk\", \"He just needs to get the **** out\", \"I'm so done with this guy\" when you already hate yourself and feel like you have absolutely zero control over who you are or what you do.... had me considering the option of buying a one-way ticket.\n\nThen I woke up.\n\nTo this day I still can't explain it. I shot out of bed from a dead sleep. I was in tears? I was terrified for someone reason. I took a glance around my room to the cluttered jungle of dirty clothes, uber eats bags, and liquor bottles that had completely consumed every inch of walking space. It was gut wrenching. \"I don't want to live like this\" \" This isn't me\" \"I didn't mean to get like this..\" It was as if someone else had been controlling my body for the past 5 years and all of a sudden I woke up in control again. Like I had passed out 2000 days ago and I woke up in a real life nightmare. It was the second most horrifying experience of my life, however, much needed. For the first time I realized that if I don't do something and do it IMMEDIATLY I'm probably not going to live much longer, and if I do, it won't be a life worth living.\n\nThis was the first time I truly accepted within myself that I had a problem I could not fix on my own. I was terrified to do it, but I reached out to my family and told them everything. I was morbidly ashamed to admit everything. Scared sh*tless of what they would think of me. Turns out? They knew all along. They have been waiting so long for me to make that call. Within an hour my mom had found a rehab facility in Dallas Tx covered by my insurance and asked me what I thought. I signed up immediately.\n\n10Hr drive from home to party prison. My sentence, 30 days.\n\nRemember how I said that thing about the SECOND most horrifying experience of my life? Yep, that's because alcohol withdrawal takes the cake, the icing, the plate, the baker, and the whole damn town. It was the worst experience I have ever gone through and nothing even remotely comes close. (Oh, and my withdrawal symptoms where considered mild) Imagine 4 days straight of absolutely zero sleep and symptoms that mirror a severe panic attack but times 10 and it doesn't end. 4 days straight of shaking, head aches, brain fog, heart fluttering out of your chest non stop, sweating, and severe anxiety. It doesn't seem to end and it's full force CONSTANTLY. The only thing you can think about is whether your heart is going to stop, explode, or if you're going to have a seizure. It will absolutely humble you.\n\nAfter a week of withdrawals it's time to start classes at rehab. They kept us on a very strict 8am-9pm schedule to limit our free time (even weekends) It's a very challenging experience. It's 13 hours a day where you're digging deep into yourself to learn how to deal with the thoughts you were running from while drinking. Things you don't want to think about. It's a tough thing to do and not to my surprise there were many people there that couldn't make it through a week. It's something you have to be 100% ready to face, and ready I was.\n\nDuring this time, my love for rocket league returned in full stride. A game I had all but given up on while I was drinking. I didn't have much free time, but you best believe that I spent nearly every minute of it playing RL on my laptop. It was the PERFECT escape. I wasn't allowed wifi there, so I spent all my time listening to music, messing around in freeplay, and flying through rings. For the first time I felt like I finally had a healthy way to unwind and clear my head. Something about doing spins while flying through rings to the beat of good music was just relaxing. I found myself increasingly more eager to to start playing competitive again once I return to the real world.\n\nAnd then there I was. I had just one more day left in rehab. I was feeling like an entirely new person. Eating healthy, sleeping regularly, and exercising daily REALLY made and impact on me. I was feeling better than ever and bursting with excitement about what my new life in sobriety will bring. I was ready to get back home. Unfortunately, home wasn't ready for me. I received a call that day from my roommates that I can't go back. A completely fair and just decision on their part. The timing was just unfortunate. They were unaware I was getting out and thought I would of had more time to find a place to live. Now here I was, standing outside of rehab with all my bags, no car, nowhere to go, 10 hours away from home. Great.\n\nI will admit, I wanted to drink. I was scared. I looked back to what I had learned over the past 30 days. You see..\n\nSometimes, the world likes to throw one last punch at you right as you're about to make it. You have to remember that the only impact anything ever has on your life.. Is how YOU respond. \n\nI got an uber and I went straight to a hotel. Instead of drinking, I went to my room, pulled out my laptop, blasted some tunes, and did some motherf*cking spins in some motherf*cking rings.\n\nLater that night I got a phone call from my uncle. He just so happened to know someone in Dallas who lived in an oxford (sober) house and was looking for a roommate immediately. To get the room you had to pass an open interview that was happening THAT NIGHT. The interview I passed for the room I still live in, happily, with my sober roommates. The opportunity I would have missed had I went out for a beer instead of rocket league. \n\n Adjusting wasn't the easiest. I had a place to live but I never intended on moving 10 hours away. I got depressed. I missed my friends, my family. This was at the peak of covid, so it was really difficult to meet new people as well. I spent a lot of time alone. During this time I played a LOT of Rocket League. I met a lot of people online and in a way I actually prefer it. I have a really genuine circle of people I play with almost nightly. Man let me tell you, I never thought I would laugh as hard as I do most nights SOBER, with people I've never even met in person. It's surreal. I know it might sound cheesy, but literally in my perspective Rocket League has given me an outlet when I needed it the most. Instead of \"I can't wait to get home and open a beer\" It's \"I can't wait to get home and show the boys this meme\"\n\nRocket League has become my ultimate stress relief. It opened a door to an amazing world for me with amazing people. It's given me peace and friendship. It's given me a sense of belonging, and brought passion for competition back into someone who not long ago didn't care enough to even get up to brush their teeth everyday. So much of who I am has been sparked back into life and it's all because of Rocket League.\n\nHere I am a while later, still sober, with a happy home, and still spinning through rings and I'm not looking back.\n\nA sober champion in game and IRL\n\nAnd I can not express just how incredibly thankful I am.\n\n-Zak\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone reads this, and you are struggling, please know that you are absolutely not alone. My inbox is always open if you need someone to talk to, but I would highly encourage you to consider telling someone you trust what is going on. Odds are, they already know and they are just waiting for the opportunity for you to let them help you. Addiction is tough as shit. You can do this <3\n\n\nEDIT:\n@Everyone, I'm trying my best to respond to everyone that I can. Thank you so, so much for taking the time to read this and thank you so much for your support.\n\nI've had a lot of people reach out to me sharing their own story, asking for advice, and sharing their own advice. It's an absolute beautiful thing and something I think needs to be made available at all times.\n\nI will be putting together a discord server and starting a \"Rockets Anonymous\" group. (If you are good with discord and want to help set it up please let me know!)\n\nThe function of the group will be to have a safe anonymous group populated with people who want to share the bond of recovery and love of soccar. The only requirements to join are a desire to stop drinking and to respect the anonymity of fellow members.\n\nThis will not be an official AA group, but I will do my best to incorporate AA elements where I can. The main goal of the group is to have a safe place to talk, vent, and game. You can share stories, read others stories, offer advice, ask for advice etc. Just a group of rocket league players here to support each other and lift them up.\n\nIf you would like to join, please DM me your Discord info directly and I'll make sure you get added. (Will take a little time to get the server up)\n\nMuch love <3\n\n\n\nThe Discord is up!!!!!\n\n https://discord.gg/zKe9dtw",

            "description": "**Day 1:**\n\nThe day has finally come. Rocket League comes to the Xbox, and I realise my chance to join the droves of hopeless, frustrated, self-loathing PS4 and Steam players is here at last. I load up the game, and decide to start off with an aerial tutorial. *I’m a sensible bastard*, I think to myself.\n\nTo my surprise, this has nothing to do with tuning my TV. Apparently, players are able to make contact with the ball whilst flying through the air. Rumour has it that some even hit it in the direction they want, but this is unconfirmed as yet.  I fail to hit a single ball, and decide I’m ready to play online.\n\nMy first match is a 3v3. The timer counts down, and I notice that I’m starting furthest from the ball. I try to beat my teammates to the ball, and a fast-typing teammate says “defence…”. I hope it wasn’t aimed at me. \n\nThe match progresses, and we are winning 2-1. A player called Caveman has scored both of our goals - he must have been playing for a while. I realise that I have the option to “toggle ball-cam”. I decide that playing from the ball’s perspective will only make this harder. We lose 4-2. I score 3 goals.\n\n**Day 2:**\n\nI decide to look at some controls. It turns out I can powerslide, and talk to the other players in my match using my arrow-pad. I can also double jump, which helps me to tap the ball into my opponent’s trajectory more frequently. In the first game of the day, my opponent scores, and I say “Nice Pass!”. I meant to say “Sorry!”. \n\nAs I play more games, I learn that Caveman is a computer, which makes me feel better about my life. I even score a goal for my team. Ball-cam means I can see the ball even when I’m fleeing to the safety of my own half or disorientated. I decide ball-cam is necessary at all times. \n\nAfter attempting a few powerslides, I decide it’s not for me, and go back to carrying out 3-point turns in front of my goal. I have won 36% of my games so far, which puts me in the top 64%. Do the math.\n\n**Day 3:**\n\nI decide to play 2v2 and enjoy this far more. I have more room, and less people to embarrass myself in front of. I prowl in front of my goal like a pervert in the bushes, waiting for my opportunity to strike. I start to score a few goals, and mock my opponents with comments like “Good Save!” and “Nice Shot!”. I finally feel a part of this community. \n\nI go back to aerial training and hit a few balls towards the general direction of goal. I consider pursuing Rocket League as a career.\n\n**Day 4:**\n\nI have spent all night dreaming about Rocket League. There is a wet-patch on my sheets, which reminds me of my inability to keep clean-sheets on Rocket League.\n\nToday I go from “Rookie” to “Semi-pro” and understand the responsibility that comes with my new title. I guffaw whenever I see a Rookie now. \n\nMy girlfriend tells me that sometimes when I need to make good contact with the ball my real body will lurch forward. “I am beginning to *live* Rocket League, not just *play* it”, I tell her. We break up after I accidentally call her Rocket League whilst making love to her later that night.\n\n**Day 5** \n\nI have decided to make some sick modifications to my car, including a Halo and some sweet stripes. I listen to Beyonce’s *Halo* whilst driving my new car around on Free Play, and decide it is now our song. If you’re reading this Beyonce, I took your advice and put a ring on it.\n\nBeing a Semi-Pro, it makes sense for me to play some ranked matches. I decide to play 2v2, my speciality, and get lumped with a vegetable who literally has less chance of scoring then a Butternut Squash. He makes some decent saves, and actually scores the only game of the match, but it was all luck. He is awarded MVP, which I can only assume stands for “Massive Vegetable Prick”. \n\nI am assigned the rank of *Prospect*. The game can clearly see my potential. \n\n**Day 6**\n\nMy girlfriend has begun posting pictures on Facebook of her with another man. He’s quite handsome, but he’s probably still a Rookie. I begin to post pictures of my high scores in revenge. She deletes me as a friend. Probably a jealousy thing.\n\nI am struggling to make my way through the ranks. My opponents have definitely improved, so I begin a strict regimen of aerial training. I also change my diet, and start drinking petroleum. To think like my car, I must act like my car. \n\nMy aerial prowess improves with every hour, and I find myself making contact with the ball 7.92% of the time by the end of the day. I spend the night having sex with an exhaust pipe. \n\n**Day 7**\n\nThat's today. I have used the goal-replays to gradually type out this report. I started 7 hours ago.\n\nI am Rocket League.",

            "description": "2019 has come and go and many things have been better, as you promised. We had the most competitive year to date, with several high-profile LANs that gave us hours upon hours of great entertainment. SAM joined RLCS and they have been doing great.\n\nHowever, I feel this year you have let down a lot of people too. The esport shop happened and it was quickly forgotten, with team decals not being updated, new teams not being featured, etc. When you joined Epic, one of the most controversial publishers, it was seen by many as a bad move, but many more defended you for it, hoping that joining Epic meant bigger things to come for the esports scene. But things are still the same. EU keeps getting the rough end of the stick, having to depend on external help to maintain a barely functioning bubble scene, while CRL gets a lot of money invested into it. You keep firing beloved casters without explanation as to why, or not even an official thank you.\n\nAnd things are looking bad for the future. You keep saying you want to invest all your efforts this year into the Olympic event, and that’s why there are no other big events planned apart from an RLCS which you rushed. But we have no information on said event, how qualifiers are going to work, what is the format and prize, etc. Also, with less than two weeks to start the season, OCE has had no announcement, and you will probably announce the season without time to prepare like in Season 8.\n\nFor me, the OCE situation has been the last straw, one that motivated to write this letter. SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE. EU needs help and more effort put into it, and the bubble scene as a whole. We need more tournaments. OCE and SAM need some nurturing, not just announcing them as regions and then letting others manage it and nor caring about what happens there. You are only hurting yourselves with situations like this, the whole world is watching. You have in your hands a game with a lot of potential: based on the biggest sport in the world, nonviolent so everyone would be willing to stream it, easy to comprehend and watch. Yet you pour zero effort into making it grow. You are so worried about what may happen that you stifle growth, like with the stupid 5,000 $ rule.\n\nAnd you may say, from the inside ‘This is not how things are. You don’t know anything.’ I may not, but that is the image we get. That’s what we see. So maybe, invest in communicating with the scene better. If OCE hasn’t been announced because you don’t have anyone to run it, say it. You seriously need a better communication department and to communicate more regularly with us, your audience.\n\nI would like for anyone who reads this letter and agrees to ‘sign it’. It's as easy as leaving a comment, maybe share your opinion and anything you feel I should add. On a more personal note, I am having my personal boycott by not buying anything from Psyonix until they fix things for the competitive scene. I welcome you to join me if you want.\n\nThank you for reading,\n\nA concerned fan with a deep love for Rocket League\n\nEdit: u/THC_kid gifted me silver, first time I ever got an award in Reddit, so thank you! Thank you all for the support and for reading my rant, I have read all of your comments. Im happy to see that the community wants things to change regarding communication, hopefully this helps stirr things up a bit.\n\nEdit 2: I go to bed now watching the amazing support this has garnered. I thank you all not only for this but for being a part of this amazing community. Hopefully people like [u/Psyonix\\_Dave](https://www.reddit.com/user/Psyonix_Dave/) and  [u/Psyonix\\_Thomas](https://www.reddit.com/user/Psyonix_Thomas/) see this and it helps us all build a better future for our beloved esport.\n\nFinal Edit: well, this is now the Top post in the subreddit. I think that speaks volumes about how many people share my sentiment. Psyonix's reddit accounts have been silent for a year, so I doubt they'll answer here. Let's try and get them to say something. Talk about this, support the x-post in r/RocketLeague , share in Twitter (you can RT DramaRLert's [twit](https://twitter.com/DramaRLert/status/1219409518955782145?s=20) ).

            "description": "&#x200B;\n\nHello,\n\nLet’s start with our story first. We are a group of friends from Saudi Arabia and we are passionate about *Rocket League* and *RLCS*. As you may know, our region has a lot of talented players and you may know some of them (*Ahmad, Okhalid*, etc...). However, the region is not represented in *RLCS* yet and it has been like this for a while. So we thought we could step in to get our region to join the *RLCS.*\n\nThe first step we took was contacting *Psyonix* to know what we could do to get the **Middle East region** (**ME**) into the big scene. Their response was that they do not have any plans for the region currently and encouraged us to make a *Reddit* thread to gauge the support from the community for the idea then later look again into it, and here we are :)\n\nSimply our goal is to prove that the **ME** region has a big audience as well as talented players who can compete in main events and hopefully win tournaments. However, our task is not easy as it seems, we need to gain the community and players support and grow big enough to turn the spotlight on the **ME** region.\n\nWe aim to achieve this by hosting show matches between players from the region at first, then transition into sponsoring tournaments later on (show matches and tournaments will include prizes). After gaining enough following, we would like to begin picking players to endorse them to represent the region.\n\nWe have already contacted a few **Middle Eastern** players who are known in the community and are waiting for their replies. However, if you are a *Rocket league* player from the **Middle East** or you happen to know players from the region who are talented, please get in touch with us through any of the links below, to participate in upcoming show matches and tournaments. If you would like to provide suggestions or help in other ways, feel free to contact us as well.\n\nThank you for reading,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nسلام\n\nنبدأ بقصتنا أول شيء. نحن مجموعة أصدقاء من السعودية ومن عشاق *روكيت ليق* و دوري *روكيت ليق*. مثل ما هو معروف, بالرغم من تواجد لاعبين محترفين في منطقتنا ممكن بعضهم معروفين في المجتمع ( مثل ا*حمد, وخالد*, الخ..) *روكيت ليق* غير مهتمة بمنطقتنا من ناحية اضافتهم في الدوري الخاص باللعبة.\n\nاول شيء سويناه, تواصلنا مع مطورين اللعبة عشان نعرف كيف نقدر نوصل منطقتنا الى الدوري, ردهم كان بأن ما عندهم خطط حالية باضافة المنطقة لدوريهم أو انشاء دوري خاص بالمنطقة. لكن شجعونا نسوي ثريد على *ريديت* ونشوف ردة فعل المجتمع وبعدها يعيدون التفكير في انشاء دوري خاص بالمنطقة.\n\nهدفنا هو إثبات ان فيه جمهور داعم للعبة في المنطقة ولاعبين محترفين بقدر اللاعبين العالميين وأفضل. لكن مهمتنا غير سهلة, نحتاج دعم اللاعبين و المجتمع العربي عشان نثبت ان فيه جمهور ونسلط الضوء على منطقتنا.\n\nنسعى لتحقيق هذا الهدف عن طريق إستضافة مباريات استعراضية بين لاعبين المنطقة المحترفين في بداية المشوار. وبعدها نتحول الى بطولات ( المباريات الاستعراضية والبطولات تحتوي على جوائز). بمجرد ما نوصل لعدد مشاركين كافي لإرضاء مطوري اللعبة راح ندعم اللاعبين الصاعدين الجدد ليمثلوا المنطقة.\n\nتواصلنا مع عدد من اللاعبين المعروفين في المنطقة وفي انتظار ردهم عن الفكرة. إذا كنت لاعب موهوب وتبغى تشارك وتبرز في مجتمع *روكيت ليق* أو تعرف شخص موهوب وتبغاه يشارك تواصل معنا عن طريق الروابط بالأسفل. أو اذا عندك أي اقتراح أو تشعر انك تقدر تساعد بطرق أخرى تواصل معنا أيضا.  \n\nشكرا لكم,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter\n\n[@UnsceneEsports](https://twitter.com/UnsceneEsports)",

It's not quite RLCS and I think that definitely impacts the potential viewership (very subtle plug but the next one for ME is on Friday and you can watch it on the [APL twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/apl_esports)), but it's still good to have competition whilst we patiently wait for Psyonix's next move in the region.\n\nIf you need anything from APL, feel free to drop me a DM on reddit or Twitter!",

            "description": "I went to my first LAN this weekend in Newark with my parents because I didn't have anyone else to go with. It was really nice of them to accompany me because they have no interest in video games. \n\nMy parents are 65, my mom is pretty chill about this stuff, she just wants to make me happy. My Dad on the other hand is very old school and has that \"video games are stupid and are ruining your life\" attitude. I love him to death but he is very stubborn and he won't listen to music or watch a movie or TV show that wasn't from the 60's. \n\nHe will never admit it but my Dad was blown away by this event. I don't think he had a clue what he was walking in to. He probably expected *maybe* one section to be filled and that the whole thing was going to be some cringe nerdy joke. He was blown away by how many people where there and how loud the arena got. He chuckled at the \"USA\" chants and the longest wave world record. He jokingly said it reminded him of the US - Russia hockey matches from back in the day. He was joking but I know he was really impressed. He thought the casters were really insightful and that the host, Goldenboy, was really good at his job. He said it reminded him of WWE and after taking to his phone, he found out that there was some affiliation between Rocket League and the WWE. My Dad has a way of being too serious and he likes to joke around and say things are stupid like how people were doing the wave or the WWE format, but I know he was really impressed he just didn't want to show it. \n\nHe never took his eyes off the screen the entire day on Sunday. When Cloud9 had like 6 chances to score a 0 second goal on Vitality's goal line my Dad was jumping out of his seat. He looked at me and said \"now that was entertaining.\". He then started predicting the outcome of series. Before the C9 - Vitality series I said \"Dad this is going to be a really good series.\" to which he responded, \"it's going to be a sweep..\". \n\nOn our long drive home he had so many questions for me. \"How much do the casters get paid? Is it their only job?\" ... \"How much do the players make? Who is the highest earner? Has any team won the championship multiple times?\" \n\nThe next day he came to me randomly and told me all he had read about the sport, how it was started, debates on how the game could improve, and how the 76ers own Dignitas. He even asked me if he could try the game so he could have a better understanding for the skill level of the pros. He tried Freeplay and then he bombarded me with questions about the ranking system for hours. \n\nUsually he has some smart comment to make about these things where he convinces himself how stupid it is and that he's right. Not this time. This time he sat there with an interest and a nod of the head after his questions were answered. \n\nI'm not saying my Dad is a rocket league fan. I'm not saying he will start playing the game or following the sport. All I'm saying is, if Rocket League could give that much interest to my Father of 65, the most stereotypical old timer who wants nothing to do with the new generations , than Rocket League truly is a special exception in this world of gaming. \n\nI love this game and this community!",

I know how hard you guys work and I don't know if theres any people who care more about the esport than you guys do. I notice the work you guys put in, it was an unfortunate accident that happened today but I didnt react the right way, and for that i apologize.   \n\n\n I hope that no one attacks the guys at psyonix, I made the mistake of letting my emotions get the best of me and thats not something I am proud of. Myself and the squad plan on proving to the SSG fans that we are better than this, and we are grinding as hard as possible for the major.

Make sure to give him some love for doing this! \n\nhttps://twitter.com/1jayski?s=21\n\n\n\nHere is a link to the gofundme for anyone interested for that:\n\nhttps://gf.me/u/yfamnz\n\n\nAgain thank you all so much for the love and support!! My wife updates our journey through all this from her instagram link below 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻 \n\n\n\nUpdate 1: for anyone interested, you can follow Link’s journey on my wife’s instagram profile here —> https://instagram.com/yochowdaa?igshid=1x7m44x8j40vl\n\n\n\n\nHey guys. I don’t really ever interact here but I wanted to make a post because I’m trying to figure something out for my son that would mean so much to him. \n\nAbout four weeks ago he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Within days he started chemo and had surgery to get a port put in his chest for his treatments for the next 2/3 years. To say this has completely devastated our family is a massive understatement. \n\nAnyway, we are starting a tshirt fundraiser, and since he loves rocket league so much we want to do a design with the RL symbol and a statement along the lines of: “Lincoln’s league. Drive out cancer.”  \nSo my question is, do we need to get legal rights to do this? \n\nHe would just be absolutely so excited to see something like this happen and have a bunch of people be wearing shirts in support of him and so many other kids going through similar illnesses. About one of the only things that helped him the most through the hospitalization was/is getting to play rocket league. We usually will watch some of the tournaments together, and I think I myself have made him watch the grand finals of season 6 a hundred times. \n\nAny help in steering us in the right direction would be great. Thank you guys!!!",

            "description": "Hello, My name is Aleksandr Vasilev and I’m a Rocket League fan from Russia.\n\nRL hasn’t become a huge thing here yet but we already have almost 50k fans in VK (largest Russian-speaking social network) community (https://vk.com/rocket_league_ru). Also you might know our love to other cybersport disciplines such as Dota 2 and CS:GO (our fanbase quantity is usually around 2nd or 3rd place constantly losing only to China). For example, Dota 2 International 9 qualifications finals between Na’Vi and Winstrike gathered around 300k Russian-speaking viewers, which is 4 times more than English did. So, I thought if there’re any studios or single casters of Rocket league for Russian-speaking community? I found none.\n\nI started thinking of casting myself but there’re two problems which I hope you’ll help me solve. The first one is legality. I know that I can’t simply restream official English translations and do a voiceover without copyright holder’s permission. So, I write all above firstly in order to ask your permission to stream RLCS tournaments for Russian-speaking community. The second problem is that if I restream English stream, I’ll have to either mute English casters and the game as well or try to comment with their voices in the background. Is there any way to have an access to game sound without casters' voices?\n\nThank you for reading this letter, I hope that Rocket League will become the next big Esport discipline in Russia and in the world as well. I would be happy if I could help you achieve that. Please feel free to contact me anytime.",

Their blisteringly fast team play, along with Archie’s solo prowess, allowed them to snuff out an underprepared Guild with ease. If they do make it past Vit, they are the team with the best chance to take the title of the Kingslayers, considering their even record with BDS.\n\nFor Vitality, the big question has to be Alpha54. Fairy Peak(!) is as consistent as a brick wall and Kaydop usually brushes up when the big money is involved, but Vitality are a team that need Alpha’s transitional ability, otherwise they could easily get hemmed into their own half by Top Blokes pressure. If they make it to the finals, going all the way will be tough - BDS has all the clutch that we’d usually associate with a Kaydop team and more, especially against Vitality.\n\nNeither of these teams is going down without a fight. The rampaging RamS and his team have returned to their mid-season form but if Mout and his boys have come with the intent to win, it’s hard for anybody to stop them",

Kaydop and Fairy Peak are familiar with championships, they’ve played in plenty, and this team is an extremely safe bet. That being said I feel like all they’re performances are always within expectations (which is a testament to how good they are), I’d love to see them pop off and find a new level this weekend. \n\nTop Blokes on the other hand is a much more streaky team, when they’re on they’re on, and when they’re off they’re off. They looked really strong against Guild and I think they’re ready to bring the fight to whoever they play right now so I’ve got my money Top Blokes tomorrow. They’ve given us some of the most interesting fights against BDS so I wouldn’t be against seeing them in the finals either. \n\nHoping for a Series 3 Game 7 decider, both teams firing on all cylinders ready to give BDS a fight.",

            "description": " Source (In French, duh) : https://www.twitch.tv/videos/971568533\n\n**Humble Beginnings** \n\nKaydop started playing video games on the PSP when he was a kid, and then he truly fell in love with gaming on the PS3, with titles such as GTA 4 and Modern Warfare 2. His father was the one who bought him both consoles.\n\nHe started playing Rocket League in 2015, when one of his friends asked him to play the game with him. Although he wasn’t particularly stocked to try the game at first, he hasn’t stopped playing since.\n\n*Kaydop : “At first I thought you were supposed to blow up cars, I didn’t even know there was a ball in the game”.*\n\n*Interviewer : “What”*\n\nHe fell in love with the game thanks to the ranked mode. At the time he played a lot of CSGO, and he loved the competitive aspect of the game. He would always try to be the best no matter what game he played. \n\nWhen he started being obsessed with Rocket League, he would watch streamers on Twitch and then try to snipe them when they were streaming to beat them live. \n\n*Kaydop : “That’s why I never complain when I get sniped, I swear.* (Lot’s of Kappas in the chat). *Sometimes those who snipe me become pros, so that’s good for them”.* \n\n**First victories** \n\nAfter graduating from high school, he didn’t really seem to know what he wanted to do in life. So even though he started some new studies, he quickly dropped out and basically took a sabbatical year, during which Rocket League became his life. He would wake up at noon and immediately launch RL, and then he would stay up until 6am playing ranked 1v1 all day and night. \n\nThroughout the year 2016, he was known as the guy who would change teams every two weeks. \n\n*Kaydop : “As soon as I started to feel like my team wasn’t as good as me, I would leave. It was a bit egotistical, but that’s how you get better. People didn’t like that, but I didn’t care”.*\n\n*Interviewer : “When and why did you start playing tournaments ?”*\n\n*Kaydop : “When I saw I could make money. At first I would win 2€ per tournament, then 6€ etc. When I reached 60€ gains in total, that was insane for me, because I was able to afford an Xbox controller”.*\n\nAfter a while, he started participating in the Mock-It tournaments, which would pay around 50€ for the winner. He would have to wait until 1 or 2am for the tournament to start, and then play on American server. He would average a 100 ping during those tournaments. *“But I still won them all”.*\n\nKaydop says he doesn’t rage, ever. (Lot’s of Kappas in the chat).\n\nAt the time, he didn’t realise he had the potential to become a pro gamer. He was just happy to win money every tournament, so he kept playing. He doesn’t even know how many Gfinity tournaments he played and/or won. *“That’s literally the only thing I would do. Gfinity during the day, Mock-it at night, every week, all the time”*. When he would win a tournament, he would write a message on a paper for his father telling him how much he won, leave it on the table, then go to bed. *“At least he knew I wasn’t staying up for nothing”.*\n\n**Precision Z**\n\nThe first time he stayed with a team for a while was with Precision Z, a team he formed with Sikii and Skyline, who were *“way better”* than him at the time. Together, they managed to finish 5th in RLCS season 2, which took place in Amsterdam. That was Kaydop's first big LAN. He admits that at the time, he thought it would be his only LAN ever. Therefore he took pictures with all the pros there, because he not only looked up to them, but he also thought it would be his only chance, since he felt so inferior. *“I had a clear inferiority complex”*.\n\nHe would try to speak with other pros but it was tough for him since his English wasn’t good. Now he says doesn’t have that problem anymore since he’s *“half bilingual”* (Lot’s of Kappas in the chat). When asked why he felt so inferior, he says it’s because he never had the mechanics.\n\n*Kaydop : “I’ve never been a mechanical player. Actually maybe now a little bit”.*\n\n*Interviewer : “3 time World Champion, I sure hope it’s more than a little bit”.*\n\n*Kaydop : ‘I swear I’ve always been late in that regard. But I have a good “perspection” (perception?) of the game, I see what’s going on, that’s what would always save me. But I didn’t realise it at the time, I really thought I sucked”.*\n\nEven though he was quite happy with their results, he says he was still surprised that he didn’t get kicked after they finished 5th. He also mentions that it was his very first big payday, around 5500€. But he didn’t even consider saving the money, since he thought it would be a one time thing. He never expected to make a career out of it.\n\n**Mock It Esport EU**\n\nAround Christmas 2016, he was offered his first professional contract by Mock-it Esport EU. They recruited him because he would always perform really well in their tournaments, as well as because he met *“the guy from Mock It in Amsterdam”* and they *“got along well”*. He said he couldn’t refuse the offer, because it was the first time he was offered a salary. He doesn’t remember if the salary was 500€ or 1000€ per month, but it was insane money for him at the time.\n\nFor the roaster, Kaydop offered a spot to Miztik, who accepted, which surprised him because he thought Miztik was *“way way better”* than him. *“I was good at the time, but not insane or anything”*. He also asked Fairy Peak to join at the last minute, and that’s how the roaster was formed. He said Fairy Peak wasn’t a very good 3v3 player at first, but turned out to be an amazing player overhaul. \n\nThey went on to do great things together. First they won RLCS Europe. Kaydop says winning RLCS Europe was never a big deal for him, since it’s only online and there’s no trophy. He says it’s been a problem for years. The money is nice but beyond that there’s no incentive to become European Champion, the only thing that matters is that you qualify for the World Championship. Speaking of that, they also finished second at the World Championship, which took place in Los Angeles.\n\nThey had a bootcamp in Las Vegas, which wasn’t exactly exciting for him since he was 18, and *“there’s not a lot of things to do in Vegas when you’re an 18 year old geek who doesn’t leave his house”*. After RLCS season 3, he finally started to realise he had potential, and that his results weren’t only due to luck or due to playing with good teammates.\n\n**GaleFore Esport**\n\nEven though their results were good, he still decided to leave Mock It because he still had the *“bad habit of wanting to play with the best”*. Although he loved playing with Miztik, he didn’t really like his mentality when they would lose, he felt like it would negatively impact the whole team, sometimes during games even. \n\nTherefore, he decided to team up with Violent Panda because he was *“the best player in the world”*, and also because they would play a lot of ranked games together and they got along well. \n\nHe also asked Fairy Peak to come with him to GaleForce, but Fairy refused because he wanted to team up with Turbopolsa, who had just won Worlds against Mock-It. Kaydop says he was *“a bit salty about it”*, so instead he asked Turbo to join him and Violent Panda on GaleForce. Turbo accepted the offer, which left Fairy Peak alone. \n\n*Interviewer : “But wait, you’re an asshole ?” (jokingly)*\n\n*Kaydop : Well yes but no. Violent Panda had agreed to play with me. Fairy Peak said he didn’t want to play with Violent Panda. So I was like “ok fine”. Then we asked Turbo, who’s an amazing player. Turbo left Fairy Peak alone and decided to play with us”.*\n\n*Interviewer : “And that makes you laugh !”*\n\n*Kaydop : “Yeah, it’s funny”.*\n\n(This story starts at 30:50 of the interview for those who wants to see Kaydop’s shit eating grin when he tells it, which honestly is worth it even if you don’t speak French)\n\n**Violent Panda’s Prophecy**\n\nRight after their first LAN (Dreamhack Summer 2017, where they lost in the final against FlipSid3 Tactic) Violent Panda told him *“this lineup is gonna last for a while”*, which turned out to be almost prophetic. They weren’t even particularly sad about losing the final, even though they didn’t play well, because they all felt like they had the potential to do great things together.\n\n*Kaydop : “It takes a lot of luck to achieve all of that”.*\n\n*Interviewer : “I mean, I’m sure there’s a lot of work as well”.*\n\n*Kaydop : ‘Yes of course, but when I think about, there’s a lot of things that could have gone differently and I would have done nothing. But once we formed GaleForce, I finally stopped moving for a very long time”.*\n\nAfter their first LAN, Galefore went on to win RLCS Europe, then RLCS Season 4 in Washington DC. Surprisingly, winning his first world title didn’t really leave any impression on him. He thinks the quality of the LAN depends a lot on the arena and the atmosphere. He doesn’t even remember the moment they won, who was MVP, if he was interviewed or not etc... Washington just wasn’t that special for him.\n\n*Interviewer : “The World Championship in Washington DC, your first ever World Title, and you don’t remember a thing?!”*\n\n*Kaydop : “Nope.”* (Lot’s of Kappas in the chat, including one from MOnkeyM00n) *“But then we won it again in London, and that was insane”*.\n\n**Dignitas**\n\nGaleForce was a tiny structure, just like Mock-It. It didn’t really have any advantages besides the salary, so they were super excited when they had the opportunity to join Dignitas, which was much more prestigious. Kaydop says it’s the kind of structure everybody wants to play for. They had a great Counter Strike team at the time, which was super cool for him.\n\nThat being said, he doesn’t think the structure change had any impact on their performances. They had a bootcamp in the US which was amazing, but beyond that  joining Dignitas didn’t really change anything for them. It was mostly a branding kind of thing. \n\nWinning RLCS season 5 in London was incredible. Kaydop says he had a lot of his friends there, and since it was so close to France, there were a lot of French supporters there as well. The atmosphere in the arena was incredible, with the chants and all that.\n\nHe remembers his time with Dignitas very fondly. They wanted to win everything, and they did win a lot. Even though they would also finish second on a few occasions, they never had any issues. The only problem Kaydop had was that he missed playing with French players. \n\n*Kaydop : “I love Violent Panda and Turbo, I really do. But I think like most French players, I’m more comfortable around my countrymen. At every LAN we would all be together, I’d hang out with Fairy Peak, Chaussette, Ferra...“* \n\nAfter a while, the idea of joining a French team started to grow in his mind, especially since he had won everything with Dignitas, playing in three RLCS Grand Finals in a row with the same roaster. Their loss against Cloud 9 in the Grand Finals of RLCS Season 6 didn’t seem to have any impact on his decision. \n\nAfter Season 6, Fairy Peak approached him with the idea of joining Vitality, which was a move nobody expected since Dignatis was still one of the best teams in the World despite their loss against Cloud 9. And since Kaydop had wanted to play for a French team for a while, he decided to accept the offer. Soon after he got in talks with Vitality and the move was done. \n\nHe didn’t have any regret when leaving Dignitas because he felt like even though there was no problem between Violent Panda, Turbopolsa and himself, the magic had run off. After all the success they had, they all needed a new challenge to rediscover their motivation. \n\n**Vitality**\n\nKaydop was super excited to join Vitality, even though they were in a tough spot and there was no guarantee that the new roaster would work. But he was still close to Fairy Peak and Scrub Killa was an exciting player to play with even though he didn’t speak French. \n\nKaydop considers the RLCS Season 7 to be his best LAN ever. For him it was the best atmosphere ever, the best arena, and having the players in the center of the arena is his favorite format. The bracket on the last days was incredibly difficult, which made the scenario even better. \n\n*Kaydop* (laughing) *: “My problem at Worlds is that I’m never good the first couple of days”.*\n\n*Interviewer : “Really ?”*\n\n*Kaydop : “Yeah, I question myself way too much. I played super badly. And when you’re not playing at the level you’re supposed to play, you can feel it immediately, and it makes everything worse. I was like “yo, that’s bad, that’s really bad”. But we still managed to qualify for the third day in extremis. And the third day...”*\n\n*Interviewer : “It was THE day”.*\n\n*Kaydop : “Yeah, we all played super well. We had to go through NRG, Cloud 9 and then G2 in the Grand Finals. It was the worst bracket, and we beat them all”.*\n\n*Interviewer : “Truly a champion’s bracket”.*\n\n*Kaydop : “Exactly. And with such an incredible atmosphere, in front of like 6000 spectators… Yeah, best memory”.*\n\nHe says it’s funny to think about RLCS Season 2, back when he thought he wasn’t good enough and that finishing 5th at Worlds would be his best result ever. He really never expected to make it that far. \n\n*Interviewer : “And you’re not tired of the game yet ?”*\n\n*Kaydop : “No, absolutely not. I absolutely adore Rocket League. Sometimes I get a little bit burned out, but I’ll never get tired of it. It always surprises when I see pros retire. I’ll stop when I suck, when I’m not good enough anymore. Maybe I’ll change my mind one day and I’ll decide to stop in like 5 years, but for now that’s not part of the plan, at all”.*\n\n**RLCS Season 8** \n\nKaydop says that after winning the World Title with Vitality, Scrub Killa basically lost a lot of his motivation which led to their poor performances during the season. He thinks it makes sense since Scrub became a World Champion at such a young age. \n\nWhen they arrived in Madrid, they were already thinking about changing teammates for the next season, which isn’t an ideal way to start a tournament. That being said, they talked to Scrub about his lack of focus before they arrived in Madrid, and Scrub was super professional about it and basically started grinding hard once again, which meant he was in great form when the tournament started.\n\nHe says when you lose a Grand Final in overtime you can’t really have any regret, because it could have gone either way. Especially since that’s how he won RLCS Season 5 in London, he says you can’t be mad when luck chooses the other side. You can’t win them all. If it had been his first Grand Finals, it would have been painful. But since it was his 6th in row, he wasn’t that upset. When you lose the last game in overtime, it means you played with all your heart until the very last second, therefore there’s no reason to have any regret. And at the end of the day, you’re still Vice-World Champion, which is nothing to sneeze at. \n\n**Alpha 54**\n\nEven though Scrub Killa played well during the World Championship, Kaydop says it’s hard to go back when you already thought about changing the team. And since Alpha was starting to be really good at the game, they decided to bring him in, and they haven’t regretted that decision.\n\n**Online vs LAN** \n\nHe thinks Rocket League is a lot less impressive during LAN, and that the best games are played online. He says that players are much better at home. When you play in an arena, there’s a lot of pressure, you play less aggressive, you try to be very safe. RLCS Grand Finals are not that impressive for him. In that regard, Rocket League is a lot different from other esport.\n\n*Kaydop : “When some teams play LAN for the first time, we’ll see what they're really made off”.*\n\n*MOnkeyM00n* (in the chat) *: “ :( “*\n\n**RLCS New Format**\n\nKaydop says the new format punishes casual viewers, it’s a lot harder to get into the esport if you’re not a hardcore Rocket League player already. But he thinks it will be great once Covid is over and they can play LAN again.\n\n**BDS**\n\nRegarding BDS’ dominance in Europe at the moment, Kaydop says he doesn’t think BDS has a psychological advantage on Vitality even though they lost their last 4 times against them. It just so happens that BDS is the best team right now, they are the final boss, so there’s no reason to fear them. When you play against them, you have nothing to lose. You just have to try your best to outplay them, which is obviously incredibly difficult. *“We’ll see in LAN”*.\n\n**NA vs EU**\n\nWhen asked if he is scared that North American teams might have stepped up their game in the last year, Kaydop says he has no what to think of their level. He says it’s hard to appreciate their level because NA and EU teams play the game very differently. NA teams are usually *“very slow, very clean”*, while EU teams are more intense. Which doesn’t mean EU teams will always have the advantage, as he points out, that style worked pretty well for NRG in Madrid. He concludes by saying he really misses playing against North American teams and he can’t wait to play them again.\n\n**Being a pro gamer vs Being a streamer** \n\nBeing a streamer is great because it forces you to play the game all the time, even when you don’t really want to. Your community is waiting for you, so you have to be there for them. It forces you to grind. According to him, a lot of pros don’t play enough. He absolutely loves his community and he’s super happy that it’s growing fast. In the last few months, he went from 2k average viewers on Twitch to over 6k nowadays, and his YouTube channel went from 80k subs to now over 350k. He says he might become a full time content creator one day, but he’s not in a hurry. Being a pro player is his priority for now.\n\n**Kaydop vs Turbo**\n\nWhen asked about his rivalry with Turbopolsa, Kaydop says he really wants to win a 4th World Title to equal his record, that would mean a lot to him. He doesn’t necessarily want to win more than him though, he wants to be his equal in that regard. Of course he would be happy if he had more World Titles than anybody else, but having the same amount as Turbo would be enough. He reiterates that he really loves Turbo, there seems to be a lot of respect between the two. \n\n*Kaydop : “He has changed teams a lot of times and his results have always been fantastic. You can’t say it’s luck. He’s the boss. I’d be happy to be considered his equal”.*\n\n**Bonus** \n\nThe interview was pre-recorded and then broadcasted live on Twitch, which allowed Kaydop to be in the chat during his own interview.\n\n*Kaydop : “@MOnkeyM00n Fuck BDS”*\n\n*MOnkeyM00n : “@Kaydop ??!?”*",

In it, he talks a bit about what he thinks Psyonix needs to change to improve the game. I think this video is incredibly well though out, and it echoes the sentiments shared by many of us, incuding fans, pros, casual players and anything in between. Here is the list:\n\n# Changes to CASUAL play:\n\n* Bring back custom/different gamemodes (Rocket Labs, workshop maps)\n* Create a Halo: Forge type editor where it is super easy to create and share community maps\n\n# Changes to COMPETITIVE play:\n\n* Ranked needs to be a first step to becoming a pro (hard resets, prevent smurfing)\n* Use pros to playtest things that affect the competitive scene\n* Remove solo standard and implement club queue, with its own rank and Bo3/5 series. \n* Revamp Tournaments\n* Make the game free-to-play\n* Monetize the esport: merchandising, etc.\n* Remove the umbrella (5k cap, 50k yearly cap)\n\nI personally coulnd't agree more with what he said. I want to repeat that you should watch the video to see what reasons Lawler's gives for all of his changes (and also because he is a beautiful mf). \n\nI wanted to post this to help create some discussion. Say what you think about this, dont be afraid to comment and tell your own ideas. Let Psyonix see that we want change, and that we know perfectly what it is that we want.",

            "description": "I am one of the mods of Overlap Esports, a community org conducting Rocket League tournaments in the Middle-east, Asian regions.\n\nI wanted to write a message to you after RLCS X, updating the situation of Asia and the Middle-East for the past 2 years. This is in reference to the article on Upcomer titled “Hope and Frustration: The Middle East’s desire to play in the RLCS” by Michael Kloos(@Wubdor).\n\nOver the past 2 years, the player base and community have increased exponentially with more teams looking to pick up players, more tournament organizers wanting to host tournaments and events in these regions. Despite not having many official Psyonix backed events, every player has looked at every event (small or big) hosted by these independent, community organizers.\n\nAsia:\n\nI will talk about Asia first as it might have more glaring problems. APL Esports have been the lone organizers and solely responsible for keeping the Asian Rocket League scene alive to this day. It is because of them that I, and a few other community members, wanted to dedicate our time and resources to make Asian Rocket League a global phenomenon. Since Rocket League has released on steam, the players have been on the grind non-stop and most of the top players hitting innumerable hours. The main issue most players have found is the servers being distributed. The professional players in Asia majorly come from Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, India and the Philippines.While each player almost has their own server among ASC, ASM and Asia East, they all find it incredibly hard to play each other on one of the other server regions. Till date, most of the players have been playing with high ping to be able to compete in tournaments, to showcase what they can do to their audience.\n\nAlmost all Asian parents do not consider Video Gaming and Esports as a professional career and make sure their kids' no.1 priority is their education no matter what. Despite that, a lot of the player base are extremely fond of the game, and still want to grind and make it professionally if they ever get a chance. This can be made a case everywhere across the globe but the main emphasis is on the Asian parents, as they are extremely controlling on every aspect of their kids lives.\n\nRocket League in Japan has a lot of support with multiple organizers putting up tournaments and even LAN events despite a global pandemic. It also helps that the Japan players can play on some US servers despite the high ping. The players from the rest of Asia play in Oceania which is manageable for them.\n\nWhile the Asian region boasts a large population and even larger volume of gamers, only a select few are able to play together in a server without much problems. The distributed servers have been an issue for a while but were manageable. This year, over the past updates, they have been causing a lot of problems. Most of the players have hit over 5000+ hours on game, grinded for days and spent a lot of days dreaming that one day they will get a chance to showcase it all on the grandest stage. As every year passes and they are met with disappointment from being excluded from the elite level, more and more players lose motivation and are slowly moving away from the game. Despite the APL Nationals and Intel World Open, a lot of players have been moving on with their lives and aren't keen on dedicating more of their time on the game as they already have. The talent pool of exciting and top players is slowly dwindling and it is a growing concern for everyone involved.\n\nMiddle-east:\n\nWhen I was first given the idea to expand into the Middle-eastern region and bring more Rocket League to them, I did not know what to expect. I was convinced that we would do a month's experimental and call it quits and head back to Asia. I don't think I could have been so wrong. The community and players welcomed us so well that it would be impossible to turn back on them after everything we have experienced with them. I do not have to speak about the region and its talent pool, they have broken barriers and despite all odds found a way to be the focal point of hype for a majority in the community. Incivik, Naywis, Johnnyboi, APL and many others have done an incredible job to give the players the exposure needed for them.\n\nMost of the players prefer playing in European servers over their main servers because of the unstable servers in their own region. Some of the players from the western Middle-Eastern regions, namely Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Egypt have experienced high ping on the Middle-eastern servers and get better connection to European servers instead. The abundance of talent in the Middle-East can only get bigger if these other countries and their player base can be incorporated as a whole.\n\nDespite the Asian scene existing longer than the Middle-east scene, the Middle-Eastern players have gained more ground since they can manage to play on the European servers. Most of the Asian pro players have put in 2-3x times, the number of hours as a Middle-eastern pro. While there has been no certainty to compete at top level for any of these regions, one region is falling behind the other in terms of competitiveness at the elite level.\n\nI write to you in the hope that you would read this and understand where we stand with the two regions and how much of an impact the game has on us, every single day and throughout these years. The Middle-Eastern community and players have been growing more than ever and their voices have never been louder. Recently, Senzo of Sandrock Gaming announced that he will be taking a step back from the game which was huge news to this region. One of the flag bearers and long-time representatives of the region no longer playing the game is detrimental to the rest of the community and players’ hopes.\n\nThe team at Psyonix are in-charge of a billion(?) dollar company backed by Epic Games. Your analytics, data and forecasts will be way better than most of what I can come up with. This is not to put additional pressure or influence your decision making in any way. This is a sincere request to Save Asian Rocket League as it is falling behind and doesn't deserve to be in such a state while hoping that the same doesn't happen to the Middle-East Players and community as they are by far the most passionate fans I have seen in this community.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nA huge fan of your game and a member of your community.\n\nArabic Translation for

عالميّ.\n\nمنذ إطلاق اللعبة على منصّة ستيم بدأ اللاعبون في تطوير أنفسهم في اللعبة بشكل مستمرّ، فقد وصل أفضل اللاعبين في المنطقة لعددٍ مهولٍ من الساعات.\n\nالمشكلة الكبرى هي توزيع السيرفرات.\n\nاللاعبون الآسيويين المحترفون بشكل أساسي هم من أحد البلدان الآتية؛ اليابان، سنغافورة، ماليزيا، تايلاند، اندونيسيا، الهند والفلبين.\n\nينقسم اللاعبين في المنطقة حاليا من ناحية السيرفرات لثلاث مناطق؛ آسيا الوسطى، البر الرئيسي لآسيا وآسيا الشرقيّة، ويجد كل مجموعة منهم صعوبة بالغة في اللعب ضد أي مجموعة أخرى على سيرفراتهم.\n\nحتّى يومنا هذا، يضطر اللاعبون إلى اللعب على سيرفرات بعيدة ممّا يسبّب أزمةً من ناحية الاتصال وذلك حتّى يتمكّنوا من المشاركة في البطولات و إظهار مهاراتهم للجمهور.\n\nمعظم الآباء في آسيا لا يعتبرون الرياضات الإلكترونيّة حرفةً حقيقيّة، و يحرصون على أن أولويّة أبنائهم هي التعليم. بالرغم من ذلك الكثير من اللاعبين مولَعون باللعبة ويريدون أن يطوّروا من أنفسهم ليصبحوا لاعبين مُحتَرِفينَ متى أُتيحَت الفرصة.\n\nمن الصحيح أن هذا أمر موجود في جميع دول العالم، لكن التركيز هنا على الآباء الآسيويين بسبب تحكّمهم المبالغ في حياة أبنائهم.\n\nتلقّت روكيت ليق دعمًا كبيرًا في اليابان حيث قام العديد من المنظّمين بتنظيم بطولات مختلفة على الرغم من الوباء العالمي. ممّا ساعد على ذلك أيضًا أن اليابانيين يمكنهم اللعب على سيرفرات الولايات المتّحدة بالرغم من الاتصال المرتفع. باقي اللاعبين في آسيا يلعبون في سيرفرات أستراليا، هذا أفضل ما يقدرون عليه.\n\nبالرغم من أن آسيا تحتوي على عدد مهول من البشر و اللاعبين، إلى أن قليل منهم فقط يستطيعون اللعب معًا بدون مشاكل.\n\nتوزيع السيرفرات كان مشكلة، و كان يمكن التكيّف معه.\n\nهذه السنة، بعد كل التطوّرات في اللعبة، صارت تفاقمت المشكلة كثيرًا.\n\nمعظم اللاعبين وصلوا إلى أكثر من 5000 ساعة في اللعبة، لعبوا الكثير من الأيّام حالمين بأن يحصلوا على فرصة للّعب في المسابقة الكبرى.\n\nبمرور السنين، يصاب المزيد من نخبة اللاعبين بالاحباط لعدم قدرتهم على عرض مهاراتهم في المنافسة الكبرى، فقد الكثير من اللاعبين شغفهم باللعبة و تركوها كلّيًّا.\n\nبالرغم من بطولتي اي بي ال ناشونالز و انتل وورلد اوبن إلى أن الكثير من اللاعبين المحترفين بدأوا بترك اللعبة و صاروا يبحثون عن شيء آخر لقضاء وقتهم.\n\nمجموعة النخبة من اللاعبين تقلّ تدريجيًّا ممّا يسبب قلقًا لكل من يهمّه المستوى الإحترافيّ لروكيت ليق في آسيا.\n\n**الشرق الأوسط:**\n\nعندما أُقترح علينا أن نتوسع في أنشطتنا للشرق الأوسط من خلال اقامة البطولات الخاصة بهم؛ كنت مقتنع بأننا سوف نجرّب لمدة شهر وبعد ذلك نستسلم ونعود لآسيا فقط. لاحقاً اكتشفت اني كنت مخطئ بشدة. المجتمع واللاعبين في الشرق الأوسط رحبوا بنا بكل حب لدرجة أنه كان من المستحيل ان نخيب ظنهم ونستسلم بعد شهر واحد فقط. لا أحتاج أن أتحدث عن المواهب الموجودة بالشرق الأوسط لأنهم رغم الظروف، كسروا جميع العوائق و أصبحوا محور الإهتمام عند عدد كبير من المشاهدين والمحبين لهذه اللعبة. انسيفيك وناي وجوني بوي واي بي ال والكثير غيرهم عملوا بشكل رائع وبجد واجتهاد لدعم المواهب وإعطاء اللاعبين الأضواء التي يستحقونها.\n\nأغلب اللاعبين يفضّلون اللعب على خوادم (سيرفرات) أوروبا بسبب عدم استقرار خوادم الشرق الأوسط. بعض اللاعبين من جنوب الشرق الأوسط مثل: لبنان، الاردن، اسرائيل ومصر،  يعانون من ارتفاع الاتصال بخوادم الشرق الأوسط ويحصلون على اتصال أفضل في خوادم أوروبا. كثرة المواهب في الشرق الأوسط ستزيد بلا شك لو استطاعوا اللعب جميعهم في نفس الخادم مع اتصال ممتاز ومستقر.\n\nرغم أن تواجد محترفين منطقة آسيا كان قبل الشرق الأوسط، لاعبين الشرق الأوسط اثبتوا نفسهم بجدارة في مدة ليست بالطويلة لأن لديهم القدرة على اللعب في سيرفرات أوروبا. أغلب محترفين آسيا لديهم ساعات ضعفي عدد ساعات محترفي الشرق الأوسط ومع ذلك نرى بوضوح منطقة آسيا متأخرة عن الشرق الأوسط رغم انعدام فرص كلا المنطقتين للتنافس على مستويات عالمية واحترافية.\n\nأكتب لكم تأملاً منكم ان ترون وتفهمون ما نعاني منه ونمر به في المنطقتين، آسيا والشرق الأوسط. كل يوم خلال هذه السنوات، مجتمع الشرق الأوسط ولاعبيه يكبرون أكثر من قبل وصوتهم أصبح مسموعًا. منذ فترة، سينزو من فريق ساندروك أعلن أنه سيأخذ خطوة للخلف ويعتزل مؤقتا وكانت هذه الأخبار مفاجأة كبيرة على مجتمع الشرق الأوسط. أحد رافعي الراية و ممثّل للشرق الأوسط سيتوقف عن اللعبة بالتأكيد سيؤثر على بقية المجتمع واللاعبين وآمالهم.\n\nالفريق المخصص في سايونكس المسؤولين عن شركة مليارية بدعم من ايبك قيمز. تحليلاتكم، والبيانات التي تحتوون عليها ستكون أفضل بكثير من التي سآتي بها. نحن لا نريد أن نضغط عليكم بأي طريقة من الطرق. طلبنا فقط وبكل احترام لكم. رجاءً انقذوا منطقة آسيا لأنها تتأخر عن البقية ولا يستحقون أن يعانون أكثر ونأمل أن منطقة الشرق الأوسط ومجتمعهم لا يصلون لنفس معاناة آسيا لأن الشرق الاوسط وبكل صدق، اكثر مجتمع ولاعبين طموحين تعاملنا معهم ولا نريد ذلك أن يتغير.\n\nشكراً على وقتكم.\n\nمحبين للعبة أعضاء في مجتمعكم.\n\n\\~ Translated by: u/Naywis & u/XtratoS  \n\\~ قام بالترجمة ناي و ممدوح  \n\n\nStraight from the announcement:  \nThe regions have been saved.

            "description": "I just watched scrubs new video after not watching him for the past year and I think he really solidified my thoughts on how some pros treat their ranked teammates and even opponents. \n\nSquishy and appjack are pretty much always forgiving of their teammates (on YT at least) and made it so when I hear a professional player making 100k a year complain about a rando in ranked I lose so much respect for that pro. \n\nI played with a pro a few years back, we won, I was really exited to go watch the vod as I saw they were streaming. The whole match he was just saying how terrible I was. I worked a full time job and had 1/5th their hours. Couldn’t root for their team again. If LeBron showed up to a club league and got mad his teammates couldn’t drain 3s all day I think we would all say he needed an attitude adjustment.\n\nEdit: As a note after watching Johnny's video (I am honored I gave him 27 minutes of content) I think he completely missed the point on Scrub and by not watching the vid, missed that Scrub was calling himself toxic and was saying 2022 is the new Scrub. I have 0 bad feelings for him and neither should anyone else after reading this thread. As I said I have not watched him in over a year besides this one vid so I have no comment on him.\n\nEdit 2: I got on Jonny’s channel without having to be top 10 in 1v1. Y’all people wasted your time.",

For me to make my videos as informative as possible, I need to point out everyone’s mistakes in the lobby, whether that’s myself, my teammates or my opponents. Everyone has really bad games and sometimes my teammates have those bad games, which is completely fine. But then when I try to call their mistakes so people can learn and understand, I get some comments saying I’m just calling my teammates trash LOL\n\nPerhaps I can still improve on the tone or how I say it possibly, who knows. I try my best though because realistically, like you said, these guys often look up to us or just play the game for fun. What’s the point in ruining someone’s day or week when I’d forget about that 5 minute game as soon as the next game started?",

The results send shockwaves throughout the competitive scene. A whopping 93% of players examined, proved to be exceptionally gifted in identifying the exact problem their team faced at any given time of the game. \n\nComments such as “omg rotate you f\\*\\*\\*ing idiot” or “can you hit a single ball you braindead monkey” not only helped the rest of the team to instantaneously improve in the respective craft but also accelerated the overall performance of the randomly thrown together team, leading them to a sure victory. This personality trait is the competitive edge of the top dogs (with or without hat). \n\nRocket League esports organizations are now trying to get a hold of these young gun coaches.",

As a participant of 9 seasons in RLCS, he’s an elite member of a very exclusive group of OG players. And he’s a World Champ to boot. \n\nI know he’s struggling with the mental game right now. And it’s crushing to see him so broken up about his recent gameplay, because you can tell he cares so much about this game. He may have been falling off of the pace for a season or two now, but that doesn’t do anything to this man’s legacy as a Rocket League pro.\n\nI kinda doubt Remkoe will see this, but I just wish I could let him know that there are a large number of fans who have been watching him in awe for years, pushing this game further than any thought possible. His final seasons spent in the lower half of EU RLCS don’t necessarily have to be the defining part of his career. They are simply a testament to the perseverance, dedication, and skill that he has displayed for the full duration of a longstanding career. The length of his relevance to EU RLCS should not go uncelebrated just because he wasn’t at the tip top of the standings for a few final seasons. \n\nKeep your head up, Remkoe, you legend.

He still thinks that they could win worlds if they have passed Furia. After that he started to think seriously about many things about Moist (10.30).\n\n\\- In scrims some teams almost blacklist moist for trolling and not being serious (he learned that from other players). Vatira gave everything in training but it felt that his tm8 were at their best only for matches. He was afraid that the team would only play for tournaments and that they could not fix mistakes (he likes to train if he sees that something is bad).\n\nIn the beginning, everything was good they took scrims seriously but after they left it only for tournaments (and he includes himself). However it's not what he wanted (so different point of view compared to the team) (11.29)\n\n\\- He felt alone and almost abandoned. Besides their amazing performances he didn't feel good in the team (maybe the language was the cause he doesn't know but it was like a bad feeling with 3 people and him to the side) but overall it's not how he wanted to feel in a team (13.15).\n\n\\- Even if he knows that they were really good (like the major) he also thinks that they choked a lot and had some luck (for SSG). He doesn't feel good about always going on game 7, for example, he prefers a game where he wins after a time out (explaining what they could change to win) and destroys other teams after (14.00)\n\nHe doesn't know if they are leaving on good terms with the Moist players but he thinks that they will be mad at him (17.40). He still considers Joyo (and I think Rise too) as bros.\n\nHe said that he understands why people are surprised about his decision and even for viewers, he said that it would not make any sense from a fan's point of view but it's more than just the gameplay (16.17).\n\nHe said at the end that he's one or even the most motivated player and he just wants to win (15.35).\n\n\\[Just wanted to add that Vatira thought a lot about this decision, nobody knows if he's right yet but he respects his tm8 a lot even if they have different points of view of how is a team and how they have to work/train\\].",

They just have so much faith in their mechanics and understanding of the game that they don't feel like they need to do so. \n\nAnd obviously it's been working. But shit like that catches up to you eventually. It's the same mentality early Flipside had because they were just so far ahead of everyone else. \n\nThe fact that Vaitra can separate the results from the process is extremely mature for his age.",

(Apparently it was there for a long time) (2.22.00)\n\n\\- Ke la win (a famous KC anthem song) was played during the stream\n\n\\- Vatira was TT twitter during the stream.\n\n\\- He raided Kameto at the end of his stream (KC CEO) (3.01.55)\n\nFinally, Kameto said that the org is making many mercato (including RL) and that it's not always about money. Thanks to the community and the enthusiasm/love of the org some players are ready to lower their wages to enter in Kcorp. Don't know if it concerns Vatira but KC is appreciated by many (french) players.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for all upvotes/comments (we have more than 100, don't even know if it's big for reddit and what are karmas).

It would make Faze wins more emotional as you know that his opponents are about to be eaten. It would also make Faze losses more impactful as now you know that Firstkiller will have to go hungry. It would encourage better play if firstkillers tummy and players lives where on the line, also just think it would mean minor regions would suddenly do really well against faze because they get eaten if they dont. Think about all the merchandise too, faze cutlery sets, faze bibs, etc etc. Overall I cannot see any disadvanteges to having Firstkiller eat people. It would also mean he would be the first killer in RLCS (see what i did their).",

I dont have to wait a month for it to hit the shop. Its not like the decals are going to sell out. If i want to rep a team i should be able to buy the skin right away.\n\nEdit: I belive that FOMO is not a reasonable tactic in this case. If you miss out on the nrg decal today then wait a week or two and it will be back for sure. There aint no special nrg haloween decal just for a limited time thing. The item pool is so little it doesnt makes sense for the esport shop to be rotational. The normal shop can stay like that because you know Epic.",

I don't buy the \"manufacturing the demand by throttling the supply\" tactic either - I see so few org decals or items ingame, I don't believe it works and makes Psyonix, OR MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ORGS who keep the esports interesting and alive, any money.\n\nOr you know, how with 1000 other issues with this game, Psyonix and Epic are not that great at handling feedback and issues and focus on other things instead. Their marketing and visual department is phenomenal - the F2P launch trailer was the best thing I've ever seen from this game, better than any UI, game mode or QoL update.",

There's no doubt that following the competitive scene of Rocket League is what made me and many others passionate about the game itself, and with that, being part of the community. The RLCS has done a fantastic job to welcome many of us to the esports scene in Season 1, and fast forward 9 seasons later, the history keeps on writing itself with chapters upon chapters. We have a player that won half of the World Championships, we had over 200,000 concurrent viewers during 2 Championship Sundays in RLCS Worlds, we expanded from 2 to 4 competing regions and many more. 4 years filled with hundreds of memories.\n\nIt's quite surreal we've been through 9 seasons already, so much has changed since then. If there's ever a day to thank Psyonix (as well as Twitch for their early work between Seasons 1-4) for the hard work these individuals have put in to enhance an esports scene, build careers for our pros, as well as provide us with entertainment, it's definitely now. Thank you and happy 4 year anniversary! ❤️",

Apologies in advance for the Great Wall of Text that follows:\n\nWith the big announcement today revealing the new format for RLCS X, there's obviously a lot of excitement. And there should be. This is a far superior format, the stakes are rising, and there will be LOTS of Rocket League to go around from now into 2021!\n\nBut if you'll allow one of the village elders to reminisce a bit, today's announcement is also bittersweet. With The Grid and all the qualification for a single World Championship, you have probably drawn the conclusion that this means the end of the Rival Series. The imperfect solution to the problem of big names not winning the big games in the RLCS play-ins.\n\nFrom its inception, I absolutely loved the Rival Series. Yeah the RLCS was great with most of the best players in the world and all that, but the Rival Series featured players I came up with. I was casting tournaments where guys like Chicago, Hato, Memory, Astroh, Cheerio, Oscillon, and so many others were on that grind and fighting for just a shot. And while I wasn't part of the first season of the Rival Series, I watched a lot more on Fridays than I did on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThen came the opportunity in 2018 to join the show. When I got the news I was in a Teamspeak chat with some friends from Rocket League Central playing the Borderlands Pre-Sequel. I got a message from Cory Lanier simply telling me to check my e-mail. February 26th, 6:57 PM. Yes, I still have that e-mail. The whole chain. I'm to fly out for weeks 2, 3, and 5!\n\nSo week 2 of the Rival Series comes around. I'm sitting at Bangor International Airport. It's snowing. The first leg of my flight is canceled. And as a result, Achieves is flown out on only a couple hours notice to take my place that week. And I'm taking his place on week 4, meaning I'll be there for the final 3 weeks of the season. That's fine. I've always jokingly called myself \"The Closer\" because on my first RLC tourney after leaving Mock-It, I did the Finals. And probably did more 2nd halves of tourneys than 1st halves. But that next week rolls around and OH BOY! Was I green as grass? You bet. My eyes are darting all around the set while we're live, I'm looking down at papers, stiff as a board there under the lights, my suit doesn't even fit me properly. It's a mess. But it was a relief every time to glance over at the program monitor and see we were in-game. Believe me: That's the easy part of this job. And it helped that I got tremendous advice along the way from guys like Gibbs, Low5ive, Carpet, etc.\n\nSo that season wraps up with the infamous dual-throws by both Incognito and then Splyce, 3 out of 4 teams promote to the RLCS, and so it begins. Every season we'd show up and Cory would be there, or Murty and Schuyler, and we'd always ask them: \"So what are we calling this? Season 3 of the Rival Series or Season 6?\" Which I'm sure was what Murty wanted to think about at 4AM while we're following the EU play-in bracket on a Sunday morning! Doing the play-ins that season was great. You may remember the Corelli video where we had to teach Jamesbot how to Spectate. We shot that on Sunday during the broadcast, and I'm pretty sure they were wrapping up the last match by the time we actually got the video to production. That, being completely dehydrated as Magu became a legend, and going nuts when Gyro & The Peeps qualified still remain among my fondest memories of Season 6.\n\nIn joining the Rival Series, I also got introduced to some dude with a long beard named Subie\\_Smash. No I don't care about the proper capitalization, TrAvIs, deal with it. This man has a great family, and enough charisma to go around any room he's in. He's also a man I'm fortunate enough to call one of my best friends. The chemistry we have together is not normal. Let me skip ahead real quick to just this past season while we were still in-studio. For a couple of seasons the RLCS & Rival Series talent were treated to improv classes by Psyonix. A guy named Frank was our teacher, I wish I could remember his last name off the top of my head. Funny guy though. One game we'd play occasionally is called \"Mind Meld\" - two people stand in the middle, the crowd around them goes \"MIND MELD, MIND MELD, 1, 2, 3!\" and the two players would look at each other and say a word at the same time. If they said different words, someone would tag out and the process would repeat until the players got the same word. So it's week 1. We're in the studio on rehearsal day. I tell Supersonik \"hey watch this\" and I walk up to Subie as he's getting ready to run a rehearsal with Spaceman. I say \"Hey Subie, you know me. Mind meld, mind meld, 1, 2, 3.\" ... And then we both say \"Pizza\" at the same time. It was surreal. That's just how we are together, you know?\n\nBut the key point of my first couple seasons of the Rival Series? (Other than Panda Express. God I love Unthink for introducing me!) We had this woman named Jaycie as our host. You may know her better as Gillyweed. We'd come to know her as maybe the best thing that happened to us as casters. Our first impression is one of the casters doing some detective work and finding out she's the host, then telling us not to all follow her on Twitter at once. So naturally we all followed her on Twitter and dragged her into our group chat. And she was PREPARED! I will always contend that she was by far the hardest worker on the Rival Series over those two seasons. And on top of being a tremendous host, she had sagely advice for us. It should be no surprise that after a couple seasons, she went from being our host, to being our boss.\n\nAnd as Gilly took the role of Talent Manager, Halorin stepped in to host. Finally, someone who could match Achieves' style! Retals joins The Peeps, my fanboying reaches annoying levels for some EU folks who just hated the idea that this NA caster has a favorite NA team. But I felt like that season I made more progress as a caster/on-screen talent than the entire 3 years of casting leading up to that point. \n\nAnd I could go on about the past 2 seasons as well, getting to work briefly with Lottie and (for one weekend) Dreadnaught, welcoming in Fdot, Spaceman & Supersonik, how COVID threw this most recent season for a total loop and all of that. But this post is long enough. Here's what's important: I consider myself incredibly lucky to have been able to work alongside so many very talented people. And more than that, I've watched careers jump-started through the Rival Series: Guys like Gyro, Retals, Arsenal, Tadpole, Kassio, Ronaky. And guys who haven't made it up yet but still have awesome stories to follow like Rix Ronday, the surge of French talent like all of Solary & Monkey Moon. Without the Rival Series many of you might never have heard of guys like Percy, Jordan, or Majicbear. If you'll allow me to put on my hipster glasses for a moment, I knew about Jordan before he was famous. It's my favorite call from last year's WGN tournament in Toronto!\n\nAnyways, now we have The Grid to look forward to. And with the combination of a new format and COVID still lingering over us, there's a lot of uncertainty for us casters - especially on the Rival Series. And as you've seen throughout the spring/summer so far, there are a lot of talented voices getting their time to shine. I suspect you should continue to get used to them - you'll continue to hear quite a bit of them along the way too. And that's a good thing: It raises the bar for all of us to make ourselves better and compete for work. So it also serves as a reminder to appreciate what I have and what I've been able to do. Because in the world of entertainment, you don't always know when you've done something for the last time. I also want to take a moment to thank Jamesbot, albeit buried away near the bottom of the gigantic wall of text. When I got the news of the future of the Rival Series, he quickly reached out with some strong words of encouragement. And that's what is great about the group of commentators we have in Rocket League. We're all a team. And someone is always there to pick you up when you need it. All of my fellow Rival Series casters especially. We're more like family than co-workers.\n\nWithout the Rival Series, just like with some of the players, you'd never know who some of us are. And now I hope that without the Rival Series, as we look ahead to an exciting future in RL Esports, we can continue to entertain you and share more stories and laughs along the way. It was a good 2-year run. Thanks for the memories. #RIVALS",

It only took one season of Rival Series to shake up our scene for the better. \n\nSpeaking of a community grinder, you're simply great, Stax. The whiteboard sessions in the green room going over promo/releg scenarios is still a prominent memory for me. It was such a good time and a blessing to watch these players grow over the seasons. I identify so much with your passion, and I know it permeates when you're on camera. You always had fun little unknown stats or tidbits about a player or a team that enhanced Rival Series so much. People need to know how hard you always work, give yourself some credit. (Gilly was definitely still the hardest worker 😉)\n\nYour commentary has always and still is inspiring to me.  You're always trying to get better and be better and I respect you so much for that. I might not always say when I do but I always try and tune in for a Stax cast. And that'll be true for the unforeseeable future.",

You studied them, supported them, and cheered them on as they moved into the RLCS. And as with the rest of the talent, you were incredibly warm and welcoming when I first joined the team, and the scene I'd eventually call home. \n\nI'm proud of how hard you work, that constant drive to perfect the amount of hype to give to every moment - no more, no less. We traversed some tough stuff at times while working together, and I admire your ability to never give up and to stay positive. No matter where the road goes next, I hope you and I will always remain friends. :)",

            "description": "The global pandemic happening right now is a major worldwide crisis, that has already killed thousands (and will likely kill many more). That has forced countries into going into complete lockdown or closed all schools and universities. And that has been echoed on the economic markets with one of the worst crash we have seen, which is very likely not over yet.\n\nIt has also, and that will be the reason of this post, brought down to its knee one of the biggest economic sector in the world : sports entertainment. Almost all events have been suspended until further notice, in football (soccer) it's the case for the top 5 European Leagues (and almost all others), the Champions League (and all European competitions) and the MLS. In basketball, the NBA, March Madness (canceled), and the Euroleague have been suspended. The pro tennis circuit have been suspended for at least 6 weeks. The NHL has been suspended, and the MLB has postponed the start of the season. I won't make the full list, but I think you got it by now. Basically every sporting event of importance has been suspended, or will be in the next few weeks.\n\n*Which will leave a gaping hole both in the TV programs of sports channels and in the heart/nights of hundreds of millions of people following passionately their team/sport.*\n\nHole that could be filled. And that will provide, while showing respect to the crisis and the victims, a major opportunity for esports that can be played and broadcasted entirely online. We all know the potential of Rocket League, with its apparent simplicity and ease of understanding. Minus sports simulations like Fifa or NBA2K, Rocket League is THE esport in the best position to take advantage of that opportunity. And to catch the heart of hundreds of millions of sports fans around the world (particularly football fans). \n\n**Psyonix, and above all Epic, it's your time to shine and show your involvement. If you play your cards correctly, Rocket League could grow exponentially and have a chance at becoming the biggest esport in the planet in a few months. We could even imagine this crisis changing the status of esport in its entirety, pioneered by RL.**\n\nI won't lie and say that it's gonna be an easy road ahead, nor will I make any advice on how to reach those hundred of millions people or to get featured on those sports TV channels. I'm not a marketing expert, and my possible ideas would be made with lots of variables missing. Epic has also showed with their handling of Fortnite that they have a great marketing team with the means to reach mainstream news all over the world. I'll trust them to make the right moves. Time to put that marketing team to work with Psyonix on RL, and reach the next step, live TV. \n\n*This post is a call for action, and a reminder of what could happen if that awful crisis is transformed into an opportunity. Please Epic, show us your involvement and why you bought Psyonix. It's the perfect time to do so.*\n\nEdit : Thank you very much for the awards.",

I have been seeing a lot of name changes recently: in fusion jruss is playing as j. or kinseh as kin. Even in rlcs the exghost team played a series with iwnl behind their name. This might not be a big deal for people that already know the scene and know the names of the players, but for new people it gets confusing really fast. Just imagine tuning in a csgo stream for the first time and simple has a s as his name but is referred to as simple. New people would have no clue what they are talking about.

Yes, but are you seeing this issue from the POV of someone who tunes in for the first time? Who doesnt follow RL esports religiously, knowing each and every roster change of the last 3 months? \n\nI wholeheartedly agree with OPs statement - it is a small change, creates literally no disadvantage to current viewers nor players, but is a benefit for newer viewers. And would add another hint of professionalism to the scene, which we still need to keep growing as an esport. \n\nThe players should also realize, since this esport is player-driven, not org-driven, that their name and their presence is their brand and biggest capital, so keep it consistent and somehow representative of who you are to get recognized more easily and grow your audience/brand.",

The match ups between the top teams only came once every month or so, so I never got bored of watching them play each other, because it was so rare and special, I was hyped whenever one of those series was about to happen, and I felt on the edge of my seat the whole time. \n\nBut now however..... The exact same match ups happen every single week, and I would be lying if I said that I actually cared about those match ups anymore, because its just so repetitive and boring to me, despite the fact that the game play has become so much faster and more mechanical. The only thing that I actually watch anymore with this esport are the upset matches, the sudden rise of certain teams, and general highlights from channels such as Rocket League Streams.\n\n I would like to point out that my love for the game as a whole has not died at all, I still love playing it as much as I did before and the general content creation is still entertaining to me, but unfortunately the love is dying for the esports side.",

Although i've followed the esport pretty closely since about season 4, i don't watch much of The Grid. I don't have any one team i am fully behind, so there's not all that much in it for me.\n\nIt is however *very* different from the main regional events. The level of play is a lot of fun to watch in itself, and the spectacle of seeing if the top teams can stand up to all the others trying to take them down makes it more exciting to me. \n\n> But now however..... The exact same match ups happen every single week\n\nThis is actually a good thing in my opinion. The swiss format makes sure well performaing teams are forced to play other teams doing well. Before, you'd have half the series in a season being boring predictable matches with the occasional upset. Now, you'll get matchups between two top teams trying to get as good a seed as possible, but also matchups between lower teams fighting hard to get a result that might put them on the map. \n\nWhile the slow feed of the past format was very nice for planning out how you want to watch, it just quite honestly didn't create all that exciting matches. This format rewards actually fighting for your placements, and not just having to show up every once in a while in order to keep a spot you don't deserve.",

Oh man, Retals mental game was really thrown off this past regional. Wow. Only 2nd place.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, take a look at his mechanics. He has not had to hire a lot of mechanics ever since buying a Tesla Model 3 Long Range. These cars don't need oil changes or engine repair, and any quick fixes can be done by a Tesla Mechanic who shows up to your house. I've heard decent reviews on those mechanics.\n\nOverall, Retals is a rocket league player.",

            "description": "First I will say that I am a grown ass man. I've had a mouse show up in my room and I scared it away without a flinch. I've had a snake around my neck in Marrakesh and I didn't give it a second thought. Heck I even played the first Resident Evil when I was 6. But..\n\n\nWhen I see a cockroach, well that's it I don't look at it again. I just freeze up my spot not to trigger it and hope it's not a flying one which would make matters a hundred times worse. It's either I would sprint out of the room and let someone take care of it, heck my mother used to chase them like they're nothing, but those living with parents times are gone. Now in the fun case where there is no one around, I would just have to take my courage in both hands, wrapped in a pair of gloves, inside my tanky winter boots I would face that motherfucker, a shoe in my hand. \n\n\nHere I am standing half a meter away from something that brings me so much disgust, sweating cold, shoe in the air, doing my best Federer serve impression, hoping I don't miss as if my life depended on it, while having as low level of eye contact as possible.\n\n\nIn that very moment, a thousand scenarios would creep in my head. What if it jumps on my face, what if it gets away and leads me to have a sleepless night, what if it digi-volves into some greater creature and eat me alive. Fuck those antennas are disgusting.\n\n\nAnd here's the moment all that planning, layers of clothes, and endless thoughts are coming down to. With one single shoe swing, worth a thousand swings, one swift downward strike that would make the legendary Kojiro Sasaki proud, that THING is no more. Alas the thoughts persist.\n\n\nNow here's the fun part. Having all this mind, one could only imagine my tempestuous facial expression whenever I get that THING as a new topper. FUCK. Here it is covering my entire effing 4K screen, that revolting motherfucker in all its glory and high definition, courtesy of Psyonix. Make no mistake that thing wouldn't stay one extra second in my inventory, the time I get to navigate to it after what seems an endless series of clicks - courtesy of Psyonix again - and trade it up.\n\n\nYou can guess where this is leading to. Now I am an occasional Flakes viewer who would lurk on his broadcasts every now and then. At least that was the case until he had the bright idea of equipping that Tartarus-esque creature on every single one of his vehicules. Now I'm confronted with two choices, either stare at his cute face (loluwuhahajk) or surf away. It would always (often..) be the latter.\n\n\nThat was until the last dozen of days, where once again I had to take my courage in both hands, minus the layers of clothes. I would sit there and watch for minutes, minutes would become hours and so on. Here I am, sitting for hours, staring at a roach. That beautiful thing with his cute moving antennas. Can't wait to proudly equip one one day. Yes I would call it a friend, and fly together to different Rocket League horizons.\n\n\nSo Thank you Flakes for helping me overcome one of my greatest phobias, something even hours and hours of Oggy and the roaches failed to do, and I dedicate my next cockroach kill to you, my friend, breaker of phobias and father of uwus.\n\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys! I was expecting this to be downvoted to hell [ : Aaaand thank you for the gold, I appreciate your appreciation.",

            "description": "Hello everyone,\n\nToday we're going to be addressing the Gamers8 controversy and the mod team's stance on it.\n\n# Quick Background\n\nFor those unaware, the upcoming [Gamers8](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Gamers8/2022) RL LAN in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia is set to take place this coming week. The tournament is funded in-part by the [Saudi Ministry of Sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Sport_(Saudi_Arabia)), a government-controlled agency of Saudi Arabia. However, there are [credible concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia) about women's rights, freedom of religion, antisemitism, and, most relevant for this controversy, LGBT+ rights in Saudi Arabia.\n\nA few days ago, [Moist Esports announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/vucfle/moist_esports_will_not_be_attending_gwb_lan_in/) that they will not be attending the Saudi LAN due to anti-LGBTQ+ laws in the region. This led to a lot of discussion on Twitter/Reddit/Discord which can be researched on your own time. **Edit:** [That includes this follow-up tweet from Rise suggesting alternative motives.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/vzujcf/rise_makes_personal_statement_on_moist_dropping/)\n\n# Mod Team's Stance\n\n**~~In solidarity with Moist Esports,~~** **the mod team will not support the Gamers8 LAN, and will not be officially covering it.** This includes game threads, live updating, guides, etc. The community is still welcome to discuss the event or make their own game-day threads.\n\nWe fully understand that our little subreddit has absolutely no sway in the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, but the response that we have to this situation *will* have an effect on our community and the greater Rocket League community at large. Homophobia is already a regular occurrence in the subreddit (and we already moderate it strictly), but this controversy has led to a significant spike in homophobic comments. We would like to make it clear that, in no uncertain terms, homophobia in any form is not welcome in our community. It is our belief that the more often that we take a hard (and public) stance against homophobia and support Rocket League community members fighting for queer acceptance in the gaming community, the more positive and welcome our community will become. That's the actual power of Moist's response, and the power of any response that we have.\n\nPlease be aware that previous discussions about this topic have resulted in unprecedented amounts of Islamophobia, homophobia, and other hate-charged comments. The mod team has been very aggressive these past few days on handing out bans, tempbans, and locking threads that are overwhelming our mod queues. Please do continue to use the report button responsibly, and try to consider how differently your life, way of thinking, and attitudes towards foreign topics would be if your were simply born in a different place.\n\nThank you to all of the members of our community working to make it a safer and kinder place for everyone. Rocket League brings us together from across the world, from every walk of life and every background to enjoy some stunning carball action. Let's make sure everyone has the chance to enjoy it.\n\nWarmly,\n\nThe [r/RocketLeagueEsports](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/) Mod Team.",

They are simply expressing their religion and that they \"don't support it\".**\n\n**Answer:** Legal statutes preventing people from expressing a fundamental part of their identity is a violation of human rights. No members of our community should feel unsafe traveling with their partners and expressing their love while watching the best teams in the world play Rocket League. The fact that KSA is a majority-Muslim country or that its laws are guided by the Quran does not change the fact that LGBTQ+ people have fundamental human rights, one of which is the free expression of love.\n\n**Question: What about LANs in** ***X*** **country? They also have grave human rights issues.**\n\n**Answer:** Our goal not to change the geopolitical state of the world, but to create a more welcoming Rocket League Esports community. We will continue to combat all forms of discrimination, including racism, sexism, transphobia, etc. as best as we can. Saudi Arabia is not the only country committing human rights abuses, and the mod team has already spent time and money fighting for human rights in other countries. See, for example, our thread supporting [the Black Lives Matter movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/gyh24w/rrocketleagueesports_is_an_inclusive_community/) in the U.S. and matching donations.\n\n**Question: Are you \"pinkwashing\"? That is, are you using the guise of supporting LGBTQ+ rights in order to perpetuate Islamophobia?**\n\n**Answer:** No. Any Islamophobia, including suggesting that any community members from the Middle East are necessarily homophobic because they are Muslim, have responsibility for any homophobic actions taken by the Saudi government, etc. will be removed and result in tempbans/bans. There is zero tolerance here for harassing any Muslim members of the community or Islam itself. If you see an Islamophobic comment, please report it as this will notify the mod team and help us stop this behavior.",

Moist's decision, and the conversations surrounding it, are particularly meaningful to me because I am a queer man. Until now, this isn't public information as there was never any good reason to share it, but I have decided that the personal risk of harassment and threats involved with being \"out\" in the gaming space is worth the fact that it might just be a little easier for the next person.\n\nI've been been part of the Rocket League community for 7 years. I've hit Supersonic Legend, led chants from the front row of Section 104 in RLCS LANs, made dozens of friends (including my best friend) through the game, and created/moderated numerous match threads to support and encourage discussion in our community. You know what they say, \"everyone remembers where they were when JSTN hit that zero second goal\", and I am no exception: I still remember watching the grand finals on my phone while at a Vietnamese restaurant and trying to explain to my friends what insanity had just happened. In short, I've had a wonderful and long history being a fan of Rocket League Esports.\n\nHowever, for the past 7 years, fellow members of the LGBTQ+ community and I have had to deal with the constant casual homophobia that permeates the gaming space. In any discussion around Rocket League pride events, trans women in WCBC, etc., people will share their unwelcome opinions. It wears one down, especially when we're just here to share in our love for the game, and is one of the major reasons why I've often taken breaks from the game or been less active in the community.\n\nMoist's decision was nice to see precisely because it is the rare opposite. To feel welcomed in esports is a rare feeling as a queer person. Thank you to Noah for starting this conversation with their action, and I hope that it inspires a change, even if it is a small one, in our community. Thank you to everyone who is working, as we are, to curtail toxicity and build a positive space for watching and discussing the best game in the fucking world.\n\nWarmly,\n\nu/RobinAldabanx",

The SSG front office remains hopeful as concerns arise regarding taking on the 2x NBA Champions 4 year $198 Million contract. This move would make Durant the highest earning Rocket League player Never to play the game. Some speculate that the 2014 NBA MVP may have difficulties translating his basketball skills to an esport he has never played before, others would argue that adding Durant would \"break the league\" making SSG a potential \"Super Team\" and a favorite to win Worlds next season.",

I believe in Rocket League as an Esport and it’s ability to bridge the gap between Esports and Traditional sports. It may be far fetched, but if we all go to Twitter/X and popularize #WeAreNotFortnite then MAYBE we can get the higher ups at Epic to listen to the community, listen to THIS PODCAST, and make changes to make this esport what we know it can be.\n\nJust please go use this hashtag whether you reply to someone, @epic, or just tweet it on your own. This is a very important time in our esports development, let’s make our voices heard. If you missed the episode and you care at all about the state of the Esport, PLEASE go listen/watch as I can assure it will be well worth your time.\n\nLet’s start a movement.",

            "description": "I was typing this comment, that was gonna be buried in the end of a thread, on why Scrub was kicked, according to Kaydop on his stream. Because I'm tired of seeing Scrub's words repeated as fact everywhere on this subreddit, when they are only part of the story. At least according to Kaydop. \n\nWether you want to trust Scrub's words over his or not is not my issue. I just wanted people to know that there was a different possible story. Where French has an importance, but isn't the only reason. \n\nI'll post it as a post now to not have to type it again everytime. \n\nThey kicked Scrub for multiple reasons. It's not exactly just because he doesn't speak French.\n\n**1.** They thought about kicking him after their first few weeks of League Play in s8, when after winning Worlds, *Scrub didn't have the thrive and the motivation anymore*, wasn't playing as he used too, and wasn't taking training as seriously as before, and as they would have wanted him to (not my words, Kaydop words). And their inconclusive performances during League play were the direct result of that for them. Scrub's incredible performance during Worlds, which Kaydop recognized, were a too late wake up to make them change their decision. \n\n**2.** Kaydop said that, beyong the language, *Scrub didn't mesh with them personality wise*. And that at every event they would never really be together on downtimes, and that's not the image he has of a team, where team spirit and friendship is really important to him. Almost more important than what is happening on the field. (Remember he left the only real dynasty so far in RL history to team with his friend Fairy, on what was far from being deemed as a possibly successful move at first). You could argue that this is linked to language as during events the french pros tend to gather together. \n\n**3.** Once they decided to kick him, which was even before the Regionals, they realized that Alpha would be up to grab. *Him being already their friend, one of the best players in the world, and with the Olympics coming made this move a no brainer*. And yes the fact they would all be able to comm in their native language.\n\nEdit : *as someone rightfully pointed out, I didn't provide the source in the post itself, and it's important. It was all Kaydop that said it on his stream the day Alpha was officially announced. But as it's all in French it wouldn't have make much sense to post clips.*\n\n*If you speak French, it's all in this [VOD](http://www.twitch.tv/kaydop/v/536413834?sr=a&t=2221s). It starts at 37:00.*",

By Worlds we managed to get the best out of Scrub towards the end of S8 and after a period of underperformance it woke up Scrub a bit and improved his attitude and professionalism.\n\nI am sure Scrub having a reset with a new team can clear his past faults and take on this improved attitude with a fresh start. He now knows what it takes to be the best.\n\nThe roster change should be good for both Scrub and Kaydop/Fairy, they both just need to step up to next level and whoever does will make it back to the final I'm sure.",

Have to admit that Alpha being available is a great opportunity that satisfies all of Kaydops wants.\nOn a separate note I wonder if Kaydop tried tempting Chausette to join Vitality, but Chausette wouldn't leave Ferra 🤔",

I think before thinking about your push to SSL, you should stop and appreciate how few people, across all of human history, ever got *this* good at *anything*. Most people never become this skilled at anything in their whole lives. It’s absurdly rare—and you should savor that fact, before you go off to challenge your superiors.\n\nLike seriously. Take a day off the game. Go grab drinks and celebrate with the boys. That truly is the magnitude of what you’ve achieved here; you deserve it. Really savor the moment and remember how you feel right now, because—at least with Rocket League—you have 2, maybe 3 of these moments left before you’ve reached the top of the mountain and there’s nothing above you to look forward to.",

This includes listening to Pros talk about the meta of the game. They all grinded the hell out of freeplay. \n\nI think at the level you’re at, you will get just as much benefit from watching your own replays as you will from other higher ranked players giving you advice, but you should do both. \n\nAgain, congrats. Absolutely insane achievement and I’m not sure if I’ll ever get there myself. You should be super proud.

You can definitely adapt your playstyle to make winning a little more consistent but it makes it more difficult to improve. So if all you care about is hitting SSL as quickly as possible, then you can try what I tell you in the next paragraph but if your goal is to just get better and become the best player you can be, don‘t worry about that last push and instead just play how you want to play the game with no regrets. \n\nSo if all you want to is to make that last push, you want to be consistent. So minimize your mistakes and support your teammate enough so that his mistakes won‘t be punished every dingle time. This means that you have to play a more reserved style, calculting every move you make. You can‘t tilt and cannot let your guard down since these lobbies will be quite fast. You don‘t want to be too defensive though because people will have the skill to outplay you and you make yourself an easy target for demos and boost denial. So try to be agressive but still careful that you don‘t overcommit if that makes sense. \n\nFurthermore, nobody really wants to have a super passive teammate. The ballchasers want someone who is somewhat agressive and scores from their plays, or follow up quickly when they challenge as 1st man. If you hesitate behind them, you‘ll just end up in a lot of 1v1 or 1v2 situations. If they see you don‘t hesitate and play with confidence, they will trust you more and become quite easy to play with but you have to earn that trust first. The more passive players don‘t want someone who is also passive because you‘ll just get outpressured too much. They want someone to create space for them so they can take control or ideally, score from your playmaking. Basically it‘s all about reading what kind of teammate you have. \n\nIf you can stay tilt-free and focused, you will minimize your mistakes. If you can read your teammate, your team has all the tools it needs to win. Now all you need to be is confident and not hesitate or be afraid. SSL is not very far away, but many people get nervous when they get close to SSL which makes it tough to play. Just try to stay calm bur confident.",

            "description": "# Introduction\n\nWhile NAR (normal airroll) was the only option used in pro play in the early days of RL, we've seen DAR (directional airroll) enter the meta with the rise of mechanical rookies bursting into the scene. Aztral probably being the most significant turning point, with his sharp mechanics leaving no choice for the rest of the pro scene to adapt or be left behind. Many pros added at least one DAR direction, and some even moved to DAR exclusively.\n\nI see many questions come up regarding DAR, and while there have been many attempts at covering this topic, most of them fall short.  In this post, I will try to cover everything related to DAR - its advantages and disadvantages; the theory behind using it; and, most importantly, a well-defined simple way to learn it.\n\n# DAR vs. NAR - Pros & Cons\n\nLet me preface this by saying DAR is not *needed* to reach the highest levels. There are mechanical pros that use NAR exclusively. Fundamental (consistent) mechanics and decision-making suffice for GC. Having said that, in my opinion, DAR is superior to NAR in every aspect, assuming both directions are easily accessible (i.e. each has a designated finger). Otherwise, NAR + 1 DAR direction is better than NAR only. If only one button out of the three is accessible, NAR is better.\n\n* DAR is a digital input, which means there's no buildup time (compared to the physical travel time of NAR + analog stick).\n* DAR is always 100% precise (unlike the stick).\n* DAR combines the advantages of both KBM (simplicity and precision) and controller (more options via the analog stick).\n* Using DAR promotes a modular approach to inputs, and allows for mental separation of tasks. This is a lot easier on the brain and allows for both a higher potential and is easier to learn and utilize.\n* Using DAR frees up the stick to control steering and not worry about rolling. It allows for some impossible moves with NAR only. It means one less axis to worry about for the stick.\n* Using DAR allows using more micro-adjustments with the stick, as there is no longer a need to roll on max speed (as DAR takes care of that). This means more precision.\n* On one hand, DAR frees us from the need to reach the full range of motion, as now even on sensitivity 1.0 it is easy to simulate any kind of movement using the stick and DAR. This allows for smaller more precise stick movements.\n* On the other hand, DAR also allows for higher sensitivity values, as DAR is always precise, and the stick doesn't always have to be moved to extreme values, so it is also easier to do more precise stick movements even on high sensitivity values.\n\nThe only drawback of DAR is making sure it is accessible enough as (vanilla layout) controllers usually lack enough accessible keys. The most challenging behavior of NAR to simulate with DAR is probably airroll shots and wavedashes, as both require a quick direction change.\n\nAnother drawback, but not exclusive to DAR is overusing spins. Sometimes you don't need to spin. Sometimes spinning too much make you take inefficient trajectories. Make sure to use spins wisely.\n\n# Keybinds & Accessibility\n\nThere are two main popular approaches that allow both DAR directions. [ApparentlyJack's keybinds](https://imgur.com/SsUB6Si) do require you to fatthumb the face buttons, but since square and circle have airroll left and right, there's no need to press them simultaneously. This makes fatthumbing simpler than the second option.\n\nA modified version of jack's keybinds allows making airroll left even more accessible, at the cost of losing NAR altogether. Moving DARL (airroll left) to either L2 (along with reverse; which requires some getting used to) or L1 (along with powerslide; which can also be challenging). [Aqua's keybinds](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Aqua) are an example of this suggestion. You could also combine powerslide and DARL in L1 if you don't like powerslide on square.\n\n[Joreuz's keybinds](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Joreuz) have both DARs very accessible. Drift and boost are less accessible and require learning to fatthumb/fatfinger even the square and circle keys simultaneously, which may be a deal-breaker for some people.\n\n# Learning DAR\n\nWhile there have been some attempts to offer movements guides like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueSchool/comments/gycalm/how_to_do_air_roll_left_or_right_aerials/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/kleuu0/a_simplified_graphic_for_directional_movement/), I believe these are too complicated as a starting point. I'd like to offer a different approach, with simple intermediate points, that anyone can learn, by simplifying the process and dividing it into steps of increasing complexity. Using this approach, I believe anyone can eventually reach the levels of the complicated guides I linked.\n\n# Cardinal Stick Directions\n\nThe ***Cardinal Directions*** are each of the four following stick directions. Left, right, up, down.\n\n[Cardinal Directions](https://preview.redd.it/2unyolxnxkp81.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ecb01c814c83527c225bc13f571e38445aa28bb)\n\nWe're going to use micro-adjustments using the stick and cardinal directions, in order to steer in the air while spinning.\n\n# Default Spin, 4 Cardinal Spins\n\nI'm going to define basic/cardinal \"building blocks\" that we would be able to use in order to steer/adjust trajectory in the air. The ***default spin*** is simply spinning (using DARL or DARR) without any stick movement at all. The four ***cardinal spins*** are spinning and taking the stick to one of the four cardinal directions. (Often called kuxir twists and tornado spins. I'm going to ignore this terminology in this post.) Each direction provides a different movement, illustrated in the following GIF from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/qwsa05/air_roll_left_animated_visual/).\n\n[Cardinal Spins - Airroll Left](https://i.redd.it/bk9qfr5sxkp81.gif)\n\n# Trajectory, Efficiency, & Spin Radius\n\nA straight line is the shortest distance between two points. If we want to get from point A to B, we make an adjustment using one of the four cardinal spins. Once we've aimed our nose at B's direction, we let go of the stick and return to the default spin. Any other movement is a waste of boost used to move the car away from its destination.\n\nConsequently, we want as narrow spin as possible at all times. Wide spins are inefficient as boost is spent in directions away from our trajectory. Make an adjustment, using a cardinal spin as narrow as possible, and let go of the stick to return to the default spin.\n\n[A comparison of narrow vs. wide spins](https://reddit.com/link/tnx1sp/video/s5189h95ykp81/player)\n\nThis means that even when you do adjust your direction, using one of the cardinal spins, you don't have to take your stick all the way to the max. Get used to making quick micro adjustments, then letting the stick return to its resting position. Constantly defaulting to wide spins is a mistake I see a lot.\n\nKeep in mind that your car is constantly spinning, and therefore, your axes of control are also spinning, where you put your stick changes its meaning. This means your adjustments should be done very quickly. You move the stick where you want to, then quickly let it get back to origins.\n\n# When To Adjust?\n\nHaving the different spins is nice, but we don't yet know when to use them. For this, we define the four following ***cardinal positions***, where the wheels point (1) away from us; (2) at us; (3) left; (4) right.\n\n[Cardinal Positions \\(rokt leeg\\)](https://preview.redd.it/9djnrzi8ykp81.jpg?width=1275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e025ca35dc21e57da5f9ffcc8fdc010d90772696)\n\nInitially, we're going to only adjust our direction (using a cardinal spin) when the car is at one of the cardinal positions. The first step is actively thinking about what each spin does at each cardinal position. Next, actively think about cues to simplify learning each movement. For example, cues: stick up=nose down; stick down=nose up; after half a spin, up/down swap roles (left/right as well); etc. Actively practice this to get used to it.\n\n# Theory vs. Practice\n\nKnowing all of these things is nice, but we need to actually be able to do them. How to learn new skills?\n\n(1) Short daily practice is better than long weekly practice.\n\n(2) Understand the theory (we've already done that).\n\n(3) Prerequisites - you need to know how to fly normally, upside down, and sideways (all without airrolling).\n\n(4) Modular approach - divide the task into small simple tasks, focus on one at a time, and eventually, slowly, gradually merge the tasks back together.\n\n(5) Practice in the simplest settings at first, and only then complicate further, gradually. As such, there's no point in immediately jumping into rings map, instead, begin with simple freeplay drills without the ball.Initially, the goal is to be able to stay in the air while spinning.Next, the goal is learning to steer on command while spinning, even if not perfectly. For example, you need to be able to think 'I want to steer left' and be able to do that. Next, you can do some creative drills like flying across the pitch, aim at the posts, etc. Once you feel comfortable, workshop rings maps are great. (My favorite is [Speed Jump: Rings 3 - By dmc](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1671658424).  If you're not on steam, you can use the pillars arena.) Next, add the ball - air dribble custom trainings, freeplay, etc. Finally, in a match.\n\n(6) [Deliberate Practice](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/chfznv/people_who_are_acctually_good_at_rocket_league/eusydo3/).\n\n# Advanced DAR, More Spins/Positions, & Circular Adjustments\n\n**Interpolation:** Once you develop some muscle memory for the cardinal spins and positions, you're ready to take the next step. There are actually infinite spins and positions. You can adjust at any point in the spin, using any direction you want. For now, your brain may only know 4 spins X 4 positions, but with enough practice it can interpolate since we've given it enough of a basis. This is the part where you just need to keep practicing everything we discussed.\n\n**Circular:** The posts I've linked at the start ([post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueSchool/comments/gycalm/how_to_do_air_roll_left_or_right_aerials/), [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/kleuu0/a_simplified_graphic_for_directional_movement/)) are basically the movements we've discussed, but pulled off very quickly, with some successive adjustments actually merging together in a circular motion instead of letting the stick return to origins. Note that when you constantly spin, you're at a cardinal position for only a very short time, quickly moving between the cardinal positions. Moving between the cardinal spins may look like (anti-)clockwise quick movements for airroll right (left, respectively), as you're basically rotating the axes of control.\n\nThis means that if you want to keep moving at the same direction while your car is spinning, you can't have your stick just sit at the same position. If you want to continue an adjustment for a longer time, after making the adjustment, instead of letting the stick return to origin, you can briefly let the stick move in a circular motion along with the control axes (depending on spin direction left/right), at the same speed (you need to get a feel for this). If you want to make a sharp change, you can also circle the stick against the control axes (again, depending on spin direction).\n\nI emphasize that you should not have your stick constantly spinning in circular motions. You should still prefer (when possible) narrow spins, micro-adjustments, letting the stick return to origin.\n\n**BakkesMod:** Some players may develop bad habits when attempting to learn this by only adjusting during one cardinal position (for example, only when the hood of the car is pointing at you). To avoid this, and to help your brain interpolate between the cardinal positions and spins, I recommend using this [BakkesMod Freestyle Plugin](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/31). It lets you set random spin direction and speed. Setting it at around 30% speed forces you to make adjustments at any point during the spin.\n\nI hope that this was helpful. Good luck!",

            "description": "Hello Rocket League community, I have important information about your rocket league settings.\n\nAs a grand champ with 2000+ hours, I've struggled forever to find settings I was comfortable with. If I struggle as a grand champ there's no way you new players practicing your aerial car control have a chance.\n\nThis guide mostly covers your controller settings, but I highly recommend you read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/iygpoa/the_ultimate_rl_settings_guide_for_the/) and calibrate your settings accordingly if you haven't already. I'll probably post more guides in the future.\n\nThere's probably a great majority of people that think 'use whatever feels comfortable', 'it's a simple car soccer game on the internet don't overthink it', 'people that spend time calibrating their settings probably are hiding from the fact that they suck at the game and don't want to get better'. I believe this mindset either frustrates players that are really struggling because they want to get better and/or converts them into the have-a-beer-and-have-fun type player in gold-diamond that will find a new challenge in another game/sport/hobby.\n\nListen, rocket league runs in 120 ticks per second. That's one packet about every 8 milliseconds being sent to the server and back to your computer/console. The controls require precision up to \\~2 degrees. The game has an infinite skill ceiling. Every small inefficiency CAN and WILL cost you occasional whiffs and lead to losses & general loss of confidence. Anything that can be used to improve your comfort must be seized EVEN possible placebos.\n\nSigns of an experienced player using uncalibrated settings include but are not limited to:\n\n* Clamping up around the controller\n* Tunnel vision throughout gameplay; disregarding other cars on the pitch, going for the ball even when another player has full possession\n* Hesitation on aerials.\n* Booming the ball/giving away possession for no reason. The player may even feel like they don't have any other options EXCEPT booming the ball away.\n\nI agree these symptoms also represent players that haven't practiced in a while.\n\nIf your controller/camera isn't doing exactly what you want it to be doing it can create a constant struggle of you fighting against yourself. This wastes willpower. The solution is to calibrate your settings. For today we will only be covering Controller Deadzones and Sensitivities. So without further adieu let's jump right into it.\n\n# Deadzones and Sensitivities\n\nA deadzone is the zone on your analog stick that prevents any stick movement from being registered. Basically an ignore-all-inputs-in-this-area zone around the resting place of your stick.\n\nRocket League has two in-game sliders for deadzones: The Controller Deadzone, and the Dodge Deadzone. The Dodge Deadzone slider represents how far you must move your analog stick, until jumping will activate a Dodge. This is completely up to your personal preference, but I believe high values cause general hesitation and overly tight grips.\n\nThe controller deadzone is the real deadzone for your controller. Unfortunately, because it is linear, it will also affect how much leeway you have between a side/front/back flip vs a diagonal flip. Honestly, rocket league should separate this into two sliders but it'll probably never happen. Check out the durazno section for a solution!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is VERY important to calibrate your controller deadzone to make sure you're able to consistently move your analog stick perfectly left/right (can test with a dodge) every time, for including but not limited to:\n\n1. Stalls\n2. Barrel roll aerials.\n3. Speed flips\n4. Flip cancels\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer**: *While I'm about to give you all the information I have available about deadzones, and while this isn't as severe as doing something like changing your control bindings, you should know that changing your settings and jumping straight into a match might accidentally take you, what I call, 'out of the zone', you may notice that you're conscious of little things in your play that you don't want to be which can cause inconsistency. With a game built around consistency, I believe in sacrifices for the long run. Grind any new setting change in freeplay for at least 10-20 minutes.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last thing you ever want to do to your muscle memory is accidentally have moved your car diagonally for an aerial while you're specifically trying to move it sideways, which is exactly what will happen if you have too low of a deadzone. Imagine your nose points down while you're trying to move left, then you clamp up as you have a 'blackout' moment trying to recover but oh wait! the hesitation has caused you to move the wrong way again and now you're hesitating everything in future plays. It's a paradoxical struggle that can leave you feeling you can't challenge yourself as a player because you have no skill, a terrible thing for any rocket league player to feel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of players and pros alike are using a **low deadzone near 0.00-0.05**. I agree this will give you the most **flexibility** with your mechanics on the pitch, can make your mechanics seem more '**fluid**', can make air dribbles cleaner, etc. However, the issue is it's really hard to execute what you're planning on doing, almost feels like you're at the whim of your mechanics. If you're an average-skilled player and want to zone out and play the game, this is what you'll want to use. However, if you're a player trying to grind to GC, being able to plan & execute your plays is essential. You don't want to be zoning out into air dribble double taps every time you have a play.\n\nUsing **too high of a deadzone** has the opposite effect obviously, you will lose a lot of necessary precision with the gain of easier cardinal directional movements. **Anything above 0.10** is generally considered to be **too high**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou'll generally want to **use the lowest deadzone possible**, one that prevents stick-drift, and one that lets you hit the 4 cardinal directions CONSISTENTLY. Never use a deadzone just because you've seen other players use it. Deadzones are completely your own personal preference. [This post by a gc3 player named Ravena explains pretty well, she even adamantly refuses to share her deadzone values on stream.](https://twitter.com/AIIisia/status/1263525600423219202)\n\nSome players are fine with low deadzones with stick drift. I believe if you understand why stick drift is happening you may be able to just live with it by manually resetting your analog stick back to 0,0 with your thumb.\n\nNo matter what I say, you'll probably be changing your deadzone pretty often if you're feeling uncomfortable. Having a good idea of what it's doing is ESSENTIAL to your progression, and the best way to do that is by changing it. Using too high of a deadzone without knowing what it's actually doing can and will cause you to experience the 'heavy car bug' phenomenon.\n\n# How to calibrate your deadzone\n\nThe first step is to use software to visualize your analog stick movements. PC players can use [HalfwayDead's Deadzone Visualizer](https://halfwaydead.gitlab.io/rl-deadzone/).\n\nThe next step is to make sure the resting position of your analog sticks has NO stick-drift whatsoever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Console players may be SOL here because I doubt you have software to display your controller's inputs. Check the console's settings, let me know in the comments so I can update here if so. If you own a computer you can plug your controller into your computer to access the visualizer, although the drivers for the controller may cause the controller to output different values than your console would.*\n\n*Console players will be forced to check stick-drift the old fashioned way by going into freeplay, moving their analog stick a hair in one of the four cardinal directions, slowly releasing the analog stick back to resting, and driving forward, checking if their car is turning by itself.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Stick drift:* A stick that is sending non-zero inputs at its resting position. You'll notice that your car is turning left/right or something without you touching the analog stick while driving.\n\n*Cardinal directions:* North South East and West, in context I'm referring to up/down/left/right on your analog stick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you calibrate your deadzone you must make sure you can hit the cardinal directions CONSISTENTLY without looking at the visualizer. Firstly ALWAYS make sure you **hold your controller in the most comfortable manner**. Do not 'slouch' your grip. If you do this, break the habit ASAP. Secondly, you'll need to test your control. To test this open up the visualizer, close your eyes, move your stick one of the four directions and hold, look at the visualizer, check if you've succeeded, repeat. Increase until you're consistent. Then increase it again by .01-.02 because you will be less consistent under pressure in an actual match.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Console players are once again out of luck, the only thing I got for ya is to go into Freeplay and test by using front/backflips. Test left/right movements by driving up to the ceiling, have gravity pull you off, then hold left and right randomly as you fall to the ground. If the deadzone is set perfectly your car will land FLAT upside-down.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's probably a way to train yourself to be able to hit the 4 cardinal directions on a lower deadzone, but in my experience, nothing has worked, I always backslide. I decided that in my opinion, it wasn't worth training, the upside wasn't worth the inconsistency/hesitation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realize a lot of you still want to use lower deadzones even if you can't always perfectly hit those cardinal directions. I have 2 solutions you probably haven't heard about. The second solution is found in the Durazno section below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's this guy nicknamed Shoop that's making notched rings for your analog sticks, which after attached allow you to perfectly hit cardinal directions every time. I'm honestly surprised no one has done this before because this is the GOATED solution. Super Smash Bros players already are enjoying this on their GameCube controllers. Currently, they're only available for Xbox Elite controllers, they can be found [here](https://shoopmods.com/). I'm currently trying to acquire one for my Astro C40 controller. I'd love to be able to use .01 deadzone :)\n\n# A quick note about Steering/Aerial Sensitivities.\n\n**Both Steering and Aerial Sensitivities** are modifiers multiplied by the original controller input. So for example by using a sensitivity of 2, if your analog stick range represented 0-100 and you moved it to 5, the outputted value would be 10. Simple enough.\n\n* Using **sensitivities** **higher than 1.3** allows you to **reach the full diagonal zones** of your analog stick's range, which are **impossible to hit** on default settings. This is one reason why high-level players don't use the default 1.00 minimum. There is an alternative below for PC players only in the Durazno section.\n\nUsing high sensitivities can make your controller feel more responsive at the expense of less coordination.\n\nUnfortunately, there aren't any more in-game analog stick settings. so in order to customize further beyond you'll need to use a 3rd-party program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# IF YOU ARE A PC PLAYER, ABSOLUTELY DO NOT USE STEAM CONTROLLER CONFIG FOR ANY REASON. [The driver adds a monumental amount of input lag. Even if you've been using it for months and are used to it, stop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv-OOn7iYio) Disable it by going to Steam Settings -> Controller -> General Controller Settings and unchecking EVERYTHING.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Durazno (PC players only)**\n\nIf you ever want to play Rocket League outside of your home setup, I'm sad to have to say do NOT use this. Doing so will ruin the muscle memory you've been practicing when you inevitably have to swap back. The current meta is using the in-game sensitivity sliders and setting your sensitivities to 1.3 or higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cannot express how much I love this program! From the dev's homepage, '**Durazno\\^2** is an input wrapper for Xinput\\* controllers. It reads input from a controller, transforms it, and offers the results to the game.'  It achieves what Steam Controller Config does without the massive additional input lag. Actually, in the Reddit post, it claims to fix some related performance spikes on Vanilla Rocket League\n\n[Here is the official Reddit post from the developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/9e56ma/durazno_v094_with_diagnostics_bakkesmod_plugin/)\n\n[You can find the tutorial and the download on its homepage by clicking here](http://kalma.kapsi.fi/rldurazno/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Durazno UI with my current settings.](https://preview.redd.it/wt2ny1tzpq261.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7ed6ca2c42901f83eaf1433ab062313302aaf15)\n\nThe graphs at the bottom represent the Left and Right analog sticks, respectively. This software allows me to do the following:\n\n* Because I am not an overly dextrous person, I am using 0.10 as my game's linear deadzone (represented by the green-dashed cross) in order to perfectly hit the cardinal directions on my left analog stick. Any little unwanted diagonal movement will completely throw off an aerial maneuver (not just stalls), which causes future hesitation.\n* Set an **anti-deadzone** to match the game deadzone to have the software attempt to **cancel out the game's deadzone** (represented by the **red-dashed circle**). This is the closest solution I've found to having consistent cardinal directional movements while still feeling like I'm using a low deadzone. You'll want to uncheck Linear and then set the 3rd slider from the top to your preferred deadzone. My deadzone now feels exactly like 0.01, I cannot notice it at all.\n* **Calibrate your analog's precision** by moving the solid green dots at the edges. If you're lazy you can use the Shape learning above but it's not as accurate. Turn Square on temporarily and use the X Y values on the side to help you calibrate.\n* **Ability to use a Square deadzone shape.** Square deadzone is an inaccurate misleading term that should instead be called Square Input Area. The default input area is the red circle, you can't normally reach the inputs in the blue area unless you enlarge the red circle by using high in-game sensitivity settings above \\~1.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a huge debate over whether a player should use Square or Circular deadzone. Below is all the information you'll ever need.\n\n* [Square (left) vs Circle (right) comparison gif](https://www.rlcd.gg/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Deadzone-Spins-Gif-2.gif)\n\n**The current meta** and a lot of **misinformation** say players should use Sensitivity settings instead of the Squared deadzone, even going as far as to say Square deadzone is obsolete. Allow me to solve that right now.\n\n* There are rumors explaining the in-game sensitivities apply linearly to every input while the square deadzone input does not. This is simply untrue. Durazno lets you easily customize that, set Center Squaring to 1.00 to calibrate the whole input area.\n* **Why would I use a square deadzone if I can just change in-game sensitivities?**  [Here is a long post about the square vs circle deadzone debate](https://www.rlcd.gg/blog/rocket-league-deadzones/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR it really doesn't matter at all whether you use a Square deadzone or not, use whatever feels comfortable to you. Keep in mind you can't use square deadzones outside of your home setup, so if both feel meh to you, turn squaring off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Durazno also lets you change the sensitivity curve for your analog sticks and triggers**. I have no idea why anyone would want to change their analog sensitivity curve unless you either A. played other games that use a different curve or B. have cheap analog sticks. I've only adjusted the sensitivity curves of my triggers, that is useful if you have trouble pumping the trigger for stuff like dribbles to hit values between fully pressed and not pressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit to HalfwayDead, Shoop, u/MakkaraLiiga, and everyone else I've forgotten.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll be posting guides on things like Camera Settings and bindings next.\n\nEDIT: quickly added some much-needed context to some paragraphs and bolded the important stuff for skim readers.",

I can also airdribble better I’ve scored maybe 3 this week. \nWrote this to someone who had trouble playing;\n\nSo I’m taking a step away from training packs and free play. LOOK AT YOUR SETTINGS!\n\nThis may not be as useful as training packs and free play but changing settings do help.\n\nFor example I think changing your air roll and power slide to L1 is a good idea as it is easier to press them. Also bind your air roll right or left to a button like R1 if you don’t have them you should choose one and practice it because it is very useful and in my opinion more useful then normal air roll. So choose a directional air roll and put that in maybe R1.\n\nNow camera settings are really important. There are videos on how to choose your camera settings which will help you decide which ones are the most comfortable for you. Camera settings will help you hit balls better.\n\nAlso your control settings. There are also videos on this. I recently played around with my control deadzones and also my aerial and steering sensitivity. And I have seen improvement like being able to control my am at better and hitting the ball. I also find it easier to air dribble and normally dribble.\n\nThings like making name tags larger are good as it will allow you to see where your opponents are more easily when you are directly behind the ball\n\nSo my advice is to watch some videos on camera and control settings and then go into free play and play around with them .\n\nI think you should change your air roll and power slide to L1 and also choose a directional air roll (I use air roll right as it is the most comfortable with me) and out it in R1.",

I probably should get a new controller - I need my deadzone at 0.18 to avoid any stick drift (but I will go through in more detail and check the calibration with that tool); that was from actively noticing it in game, so the actual value may need to be even higher.\n\nThat's a really interesting section on aerial sensitivity - I thought 1.0 let you access the maximum values, didn't realise it limited you in the diagonals.\n\nWhat are the pros allowed to use at LAN? Do they use these external deadzone programs? It's not something I have to worry about ATM but I'd be wary to use them or recommend them if there's a risk that when someone goes pro they now have to relearn their muscle memory because they are not allowed in competition.",

            "description": "I dropped heavily from Diamond to Plat II in 3s. No big deal, shit happens. I am confident in my own skills to climb out but playing with people who have the mentality that 1 kick off goal or 2 goals in 30 seconds or the score being 3-0 in the first minute means the game is over is so demotivating.\n\nI played 4 ranked games today after a day off and every game actually felt easy. I won the first 2 games and I was in the zone. In my 3rd game, my teammate left after 2 minutes because he provided a pass to the other team and because they scored again immediately after kick off. But even after he left, we got within 1 goal but ultimately lost. In the 4th game we were up 2-0 and then they came back 3-2 all in the span of 1:30. At 3:30 he put up the FF vote but we kept playing while he afked in his kick off position the entire game. This game went to OT and we lost 6-5 playing 2v3. The craziest thing to me is the 3rd guy actually watched all this play out and could have hopped back in at any time, but he was too stubborn to do so.\n\nI get that people are shit in low rank. Even in \"high\" rank. I get that people have bad days. But my biggest gripe is that today I played 4 winnable games but ultimately lost to factors beyond my control and I'm exactly back to where I started had I not played at all.\n\nThis is just so demotivating. I can accept losses where we got outplayed and the better team won. It's not even something like \"oh it happens...it's just 1 game..you'll get over it\". It literally feels like more than half my losses come from people who give up or leave the game without even playing more than half the fucking game. The mentality these players have in lower levels just makes it feel like they really don't give a shit about ranked and play it like it's a casual and I don't know how to overcome this. Every time I think I get into a groove and am ready to go on a streak, shit like this happens.\n\n\nAnd yes I understand that it's equally as likely (or more likely) to happen to the other team, but that is beyond the point. It's that this is an issue at all. \n\nI am not good enough to carry 3s 2v3 as much as I would like to be. If I could, I'd probably win every actual 3v3. I don't want to play 1s/2s as I actually enjoy the game mode of 3s. It feels more challenging. \n\nI would play 3s with friends if I had any, but I find that playing with friends ends up being counterproductive to progress because now you have additional people that can go on tilt and are limited to one type of playstyle that involves them. I've tried finding people to play with on RL Discord and it seems people have a knack for lying about their rank or expect the person they play with to hard carry the game and then quit after 1 loss even though we're the same rank.\n\nI thought maybe the problem was me and that's why I couldn't climb out. I played 20 games on a new account and I am currently D3 Div 2 on it. Of course that could change, but I shouldn't even have to resort to that. It was more to see whether I was actually the issue or not. I also understand the first 40-50 games are most volatile, but I don't see the benefit to that. I should be able to climb out of my primary account. \n\nThis shit makes me not want to play, even after having taken a break.\n\n**EDIT**: I appreciate all the responses, wasn't expecting this to blow up. I thought more people would just tell me it's a part of the game, deal with it, and move on, which isn't very helpful. I primarily wrote this due to feeling like I was slumping and then the one whiff I get at thinking I'm out, it just puts me right back in. I enjoy RL when I can play it like it's intended purpose but if I'm basically flipping a coin every game to determine whether it will be a \"standard\" game or just completely lopsided it doesn't feel fun anymore. \n\nI honestly don't know what better solutions would be. Apparently preventing MMR losses for the people who don't leave would lead to boosting which doesn't make sense to me. Another idea would be to lower the FF vote to 2:00 instead of 3:30 considering the latter isn't even half the game. Increasing the timer on rejoining a new match could also be an option. In any case, I don't foresee any of that happening.",

                    "comment": "I don't know about other things, however, if someone leaves the game early, given that you haven't agreed to forfeit yet, then you shouldn't lose your mmr, I don't understand (from a point of view of fairness) why RL has this system where if someone loses connection or decides to completely leave the match in the middle, the other member should lose mmr. Off course, the opponents should gain mmr if you lose, cause, they didn't have anything to do with your teammate leaving, but why should you lose mmr? However, Maybe the reason for this has to do with some kind of mmr count system or something, maybe that's why rocket league does this. That's why I wrote \"from a point of view of fairness\".\n\nNow, coming to your post, I think, in this game, those who deal with many shitty experiences, and still keep playing and keep improving ultimately ranks up. I think, in order to rank up in 2s, (SOLO queueing) let's say you are d3, you need to have a consistent champ 1-2 ish mechanics level, to reach champ 1. Many times, you will have to carry your teammate, compensate for their mistakes, play more defensively a lot of the times cause you can't trust his capabilities, currently in that match. And of course, you will de-rank oftentimes, cause out of nowhere, your teammate decides to leave the game when you are having a shitty day already. It may sound cliché, but that's part of the game. 3s a different game, it's always better to party up with friends in this gamemode, but you can still rank up, but this one will be comparatively more difficult.\n\nPoint is, you will have to deal with this shit, there is no other way. Psyonix or Epic games won't read your post, or maybe they will, but won't change anything, at least quickly. Companies need incentives to change something, something that will make them more money. And the players will obviously not change, you can't change them. Also, you never know how your teammates have prepared before queuing up in ranked. I've seen countless players playing as if they didn't really warm up much before the match. So many friends of mine, when partying up said to me, they don't like \"Casuals\", they loathe casuals. So, if you haven't warmed up for even 20 mins, aren't willing to play at least 1-2 casuals to warm up either, then well, where are you warming up? In ranked matches? What will that do to me? I will likely lose the matches alongside you cause you didn't do some basic groundwork.\n\nSo, in order to deal with this, First, forget that \"you have to rank up to this level within this period of time\", kill this mentality, this will only frustrate you. You will have bad/incompatible teammates, sometimes some guys will smurf on you, sometimes your teammates internet will go down in the middle, some will rage quit, and yes, sometimes, even after training the whole day, you yourself will play downright terribly one match after another. You think you are supposed to go on a streak, well, rocket league has different plan for ya.\n\nOne thing you can do, is play like 5 matches, and try to win 3 of them at least, if you have done so, you are successful in your quest. 10 matches, try to win at least 6. If you for some reason, lose 3 matches in a row, it's time to quit playing for now, maybe later today, or tomorrow, play casuals until then. This has helped me. Maybe it could help you too.",

I’ve seen a video on here explaining why not to forfeit with like a minute of extra time left and I really liked it. I had a similar event happen a few days ago in a tournament. It was the final game of the finals and we scored a goal then the other team scored four goals in a row. At the two minute mark one of the people hit the forfeit button but I refused. Luckily they kept trying and within the last minute of play I scored two goal and then I sunk a buzzer beater tiring it up and going into over time. We kept going for two and a half minutes of that until we scored and ended up winning the tournament. I feel dumb though because I forgot to get a replay of it. But this is a good example of what you said it’s disheartening when your teammate just wants to quit when there’s still plenty of time to turn it around. What makes it worst is when the other team acts like there’s no hope and tries to get them to quit. But just keep trying and hopefully they will get weeded out.",

Also some people are probably not honest with themselves or able to recognise quickly enough when they’re on tilt.\n\nSwitching to tac qc only helps me keep a level head, and apart from kick offs there’s not much reason to communicate with randoms; I only call out kick off, and when I’m low on boost. There’s never really any reason to tell your teammate to “take the shot” other than at KO.\n\nIt’s not foolproof, I still run into angry FFs in 3s, or get teammates that wind each other up, but it is one mental hole in my game which was easily patched.",
