The language is specific, like this has either happened before or will happen in the future, as the narrator seems to have expected this in some way. The poem reads metaphorically, but there's nothing stopping it from being fantastical; the frog could literally be speaking, and my brain tends to picture that automatically. It adds to the sort of dreamy, laid back feeling of the story. \n\nIs the speech even assigned to the frog at all? Or is it meant to read closer to \"it's like... what the fuck man?\" It could be a kid or teenager, having nothing profound to think about the situation beyond how odd it is. Or it could really just be some person trying to understand a frog. Lots of fun no matter how you look at it.",

No, poetry is a more particular sort of language.\n\nNor is poetry merely language that makes one feel. We know when we are told something hurtful that we are not in the presence of a poet.\n\nOn the flip side, while not all art made with language is poetry, poetry is art made with language. And while not all word art that transcends literal meaning is poetry, poetry is language that conveys more than the sum of its parts. And while not all language charged with meaning is poetry, poetry \u2014 good poetry \u2014 is language charged with meaning to the utmost possible degree. All human interaction is necessarily subjective, yet every poet who has tried to write better manages to make sense of that pursuit, and manages to find something approaching \"better\" to be an emergent property of that subjectivity. Last, although not all wordplay is poetry, poetry is first a form of play that uses language.\n\nMy favorite definition of poetry is that poetry is what poets write, and a poet is someone who writes poetry. It sounds glib, but I like it, and I would say anyone who engages with language on the level of art-play with the genuine intent of writing a poem, and of using language in a performative way that says \"this is poetry, please shift your perception to read it as such,\" is doing it right.\n\nAnyway, I like this thing with the frogs.",

It is within its nature but I look at him because I want to see nature which does not seem to want me near it.\nWhy can I not be a part of that frog that interests me? Why is he fleeing? I guess although we rule over nature it will always flee from us if it has a chance since we are a danger to it.\nThe frog jumping away reminds us of our own position in nature which we forget about most of the time.",

But afterwards, it is followed by enjambement. This matters so much as we are told it hops away and the enjambment allows us to imagine the pace of the hop. We are told it goes away from the poet and this implies the frog is scared of what lurks. This could mean it\u2019s trying to suggest the frog is society, the youth specifically being scared of truly the most scariest thing ever, the government. We are the frog, running from the government drones but because you pay taxes, you are also the drone. This implies that us united are paying for our own downfall, we are destroying ourselves. But then we go to the next line, so short yet so elegant\u2026 the shortness suggests we are heartbroken from the past moment but also the message that we will kill ourselves. It makes us feel stopped so sudden, how sudden the changes and the message is. And finally, the line \u2018what the fuck man\u2019. At first, we thinks it\u2019s just heartbroken. The strong language \u2018fuck\u2019 tells us how broken we feel after the events. But we fail to see the hidden message. Until you realise, we are questioning the governments authority with rhetorical question. It makes us feel motivated to start a revolution to overthrow our own destruction. In conclusion, the message is strong and we MUST stop the government before we destroy ourselves. Don\u2019t pay taxes is a simple summary of what it\u2019s telling us.",

                "comment": "&#x200B;\n\n\u201cMasks\u201d approaches individualism explicitly though the diction, but implicitly using rhythm, and rhyme. Each line of the poem contains 4 significant syllables, except for \u201cThey searched for blue,\u201d and \u201cThen passed right by\u201d which ends up sounding as though it has four when read out-loud, creating a very mechanical and strict syncopation. The rhythm highlights the lack of individualism the \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d conform to when they keep their \u201cblue skin\u201d hidden. The first four lines of the poem have an abcb rhyme scheme, while the last four lines have an AACA. Like the rhythm, the rhyme is very simple and really emphasizes how significant the conformity is in this poem. Although the rhyme is rather mechanical, the expected rhyme scheme for abcb would be abab. The two off rhymes signify a breaking away from the conformity and a return to the individual. The last four lights have an aaca rhyme, where one line stands out from the others to denote an individual deviating from the crowd.\n\nThe climax of the poem is when the two people pass by each other, but because they are pretending to be something they are not, they end up passing right by without knowing. These last three lines stood out the most to me because it changes the tone of the poem completely. \u201cTheir whole life through,\u201d can be read as if they were searching through their whole life for someone like themselves, as well as their lives being over. Suddenly this simple message about being yourself takes a very serious and dark turn. In deciding to create a video interpretation about this poem, I had to choose whether to keep the same dark ending Silverstein imposes, or create my own. Instead I attempted to create a new emotion to add to the experience of being someone else through disruptive rhythm, extreme close-ups and a totally disjointed and unsatisfying ending.",

I squeezed a grapefruit into a juice glass. I scraped the ashes from the frying pan and rinsed the butter off the counter. I washed the dishes and folded the towels.\n\nThe morning after I killed myself, I fell in love. Not with the boy down the street or the middle school principal. Not with the everyday jogger or the grocer who always left the avocados out of the bag. I fell in love with my mother and the way she sat on the floor of my room holding each rock from my collection in her palms until they grew dark with sweat. I fell in love with my father down at the river as he placed my note into a bottle and sent it into the current. With my brother who once believed in unicorns but who now sat in his desk at school trying desperately to believe I still existed.\n\nThe morning after I killed myself, I walked the dog. I watched the way her tail twitched when a bird flew by or how her pace quickened at the sight of a cat. I saw the empty space in her eyes when she reached a stick and turned around to greet me so we could play catch but saw nothing but sky in my place. I stood by as strangers stroked her muzzle and she wilted beneath their touch like she did once for mine.\n\nThe morning after I killed myself, I went back to the neighbors\u2019 yard where I left my footprints in concrete as a two year old and examined how they were already fading. I picked a few daylilies and pulled a few weeds and watched the elderly woman through her window as she read the paper with the news of my death. I saw her husband spit tobacco into the kitchen sink and bring her her daily medication.\n\nThe morning after I killed myself, I watched the sun come up. Each orange tree opened like a hand and the kid down the street pointed out a single red cloud to his mother.\n\nThe morning after I killed myself, I went back to that body in the morgue and tried to talk some sense into her. I told her about the avocados and the stepping stones, the river and her parents. I told her about the sunsets and the dog and the beach.\n\nThe morning after I killed myself, I tried to unkill myself, but couldn\u2019t finish what I started.",

But even still, because there is a line break, there's also no need for the commas. So a comma, which is a less dramatic break between clauses, is grammatically preferred but formally unnecessary.\n\nIn addition to this, most online writing eschews formal punctuation. In texts, Twitter, and Reddit, many writers intentionally avoid final punctuation and even capitals. With all this, the periods take on a rather peculiar quality, one that (in my personal taste) attempts to compensate for an otherwise unexceptional poem.",
