And I dread going back to it because I know it wasn't made for someone of my \"skill\" level. As much I love that game and Handsome Jack as a character, it has scarred me for life. And now I hate dying to more reasons than it just sucks to lose progress. You take my money, my dignity, and piss all over me.\n\n\nSo yeah, it's definitely that one. Prequel actually fixed a lot of issues I had with Checkpoint placement and has characters I enjoy playing more.\u00a0",

Nope. You do that and CD1 is still not over, not even *half* over.\n* So, we kill the three Black Waltz and we are free right? Nope, here comes the black mage army.\n* So, like, we rescue the princess and CD2 is over right? Nope. Remember the world map? It wasn't a world map, it was a *continental* map. Of the only continent explored so far. Here is an underground cave to a new continent. Enjoy.\n* (Later on) Well we are done with the new continent (not really), the war is over, now it's time to celebrate and do the princess coronation and we are done right? Nope. There is stuff to do. Here is a world map.\n\nThe game has enough plot and places to explore that you can see a lot of full fledged antagonists retire and leave peacefully within the game's story. Betrix is like a final boss fight in like CD1.\n\nThe game even has a *low level super boss*, Tantarian, that can only be beaten in the Alexandrian library in mid-CD2  or early-CD3 in two blink and you will miss it moments.\n\nEDIT: Also Golden Sun: The Lost Age.

I don\u2019t remember any groundbreaking releases, just a few big formulaic AAA games and DAI that at least experimented with something. \n\nI liked DAI, played 300 hours of it, but the combat has aged worse than DAO and DA2, it\u2019s some clunky combo between tactical and action rpg, there are parts in the game where I want a better pause mechanic and parts where I think the movement needs to be better and a dodge mechanic is needed. It\u2019s very rough at this point.\n\nThe story is interesting and epic but it\u2019s also kind of a mess, there is just too much going on at once, too many conflicts, it\u2019s hard to know who the big bad is. \n\nThe frostbite engine shows it\u2019s first problems with being used by BioWare, many of the problems in MEA existed in DAI but not as extreme. \n\nThe open world is cool but too many fetch quests and weak side quests. The writing is just kinda all over the place in terms of quality.\n\nThe game also starts leaning more and more into BioWare games pretty much just being a dating sim. Instead of being fun games with interesting gameplay and combat, BioWare games feel more and more tailoring to dating sim weirdos on the internet. I like a good romance subplot but it just feels like too much. \n\nCharacters are better than DA2, but not as good as DAO.\n\nThe game is carried by an absolutely devastatingly good music score, maybe one of the greatest of all time, really cool and awesome moments in the game, good lord expansion of the Dragon Age world, solid expansion packs (although not as good as DAO:A), decent characters, and some cool Dragon fights if a bit clunky. \n\nTLDR: DAI is just kind of all the clunky parts of DAO and DA2 and with slightly weaker story and characters and a worse engine and weak side quests.",

The only game that rivalled it was DOOM: Eternal, which should have won tbh.",

We are 1 and 2 on the leaderboards just about every game.\n\nHe invited me to a party chat just now and I immediately was like oh fuck this is not an adult.\n\nI told him I had to wrap presents and got off.\n\nJust logged back on and have 4 party invites from him. I was just going to ghost him but probably better to just tell him I don't mind playing the game with him but I'm way too old to be in party chat with him? I've never had kids so not sure the best way to handle this.\n\nUpdate: I told him I'm too old to voice chat with him. But we can still play together when he sees me on; told him to just join my game like he's been doing. Also told him he's a talented gamer for his age (11) and if he keeps at it maybe he can be a pro someday. He said he understood and thanked me and said he hopes so.\n\n  \nUpdate 2: Was not expecting this to blow up. Was just looking for some opinions. I already handled it. However, just to confirm something - I DO NOT MIND PLAYING WITH THE KID. We spent like 12 hours playing together over the weekend. I've told him I don't mind playing with him. I'm just not going to chat with him in party chat. To the few people who are saying things like it's more concerning that I am scared to chat with the kid: I'm firmly in the camp that says adults should not WANT to party chat with random kids on the internet unless there's very good reason for it.  Some of you have good examples (running a guild that kids are in) - but that's not the case here and I've never been a member of a guild that allowed kids. ",

The example I use when people say it\u2019s weird is that if you went to a football stadium there probably people as young as 10 and as old as 80 all doing the same thing and no one cares.",

I asked him why it's so funny and he said \"well I'm rank 1 worldwide in jet kills\". An I was sceptical but he just said \"check out my profile dude\". And what can I say... This 15 yo boy (I was 19 at that time) was indeed rank 1 player on all platforms in jet kills. He had about 20k kills more than the rank two payer on ALL platforms. I enyoyed watching him fly jet for so many hours.\n\nHere's a clip of that: https://youtu.be/JsOOoRh2Lu0 (about half video in the jet fighting starts).\n\nHe was young but very good at it.",

So finally he said he got surgery to fix his voice. Then we are a discord with another \"younger\" kid (like 14??) i would sometimes play with, and he started talking and i knew he knew the other kid and was not an adult. He was maybe 12-13 and the other kid knew him. So for months some weird kid manipulated me into thinking he was older. Then in discord chat he said it was his younger brother and \"we was fucking wit chu\", so i thought, oh my bad then. Fast forward to next week to find out it was not, he was just a kid who was pretending to be an adult for months. I stopped being friends with anyone who didnt have a mic after that.",

We were both high levels and found fun in helping new players, and a good majority of said new players were kids, one of whom was 11 years old. We never cussed around him, never discussed adult topics, never asked about his personal life, etc. Basically, we didn't make things weird. \n\nIt probably helped a lot that you could always hear his dad watching him play games in the background, though.",

I quickly disconnected and hoped he was old enough to assume my wifi cut out or something.",

He asked me how old I was and I was 20 at the time (it was about an year ago), and then he said he had to ask him mom something and came back sounding super disappointed and said we can't play together.\n\n\nPoor guy. I'm pretty good with kids and my sister is around the same age so I completely understand and actually applaud his parents for taking that active role in his gaming experience. Buncha weirdos and p3d0s on this app and probably those games as well, so I don't blame them, but it was a bit disappointing that we couldn't keep queueing. He was the first friend I made on Fortnite that weren't my friends from other games (much older) and the interaction was pretty wholesome and nothing lewd/weird/nefarious, but damn I grew up hearing horror stories about all the weird shit that took place on websites like omegle with older creeps so I'm really glad internet awareness is at a point where parents are taking that active role a little more seriously.\n\n\nIt probably didn't help that I was 20 but sound like 28-35. Randoms call me daddy in games pretty often when I talk so I would be freak the fuck out if I had a kid and they were queuing with some guy who sounds old as fuck like a cigarette chainsmoker corpse husband knockoff.",

Sure, it takes adults to initiate that boundary-building in kids, but that\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s important that you highlight to kids that it\u2019s okay to interact with adults as long as they keep their safety in mind.\n\nOtherwise, I\u2019d add in the general reassurance that you\u2019re good for what you did and it isn\u2019t weird for people to be a little surprised/discomforted about their sudden proximity to children. Being around children is awkward, it\u2019s normal (and healthy if anything) to be aware of the power and influence you have in your dynamic to kids, and being able to recognize that is good.

He wasn't the competitive type, but he enjoyed a win like anyone else. \n\nThe thing is, he made sure to make these kids feel comfortable being themselves in the game, enjoy the many things they do in the game, and even share that passion with more kids. I was that kid once, without realizing it, because he did it naturally and organically, and there was never anything weird about it other than being two or more people enjoying the games, with no age gap in mind. Some of his \"adult\" friends even started doing the same.\n\nWhen he passed away, A LOT of young people really felt the loss, despite having never met him in person. Some of those \"kids\" now do the same thing about \"adopting their gaming kid\". I don't, but because I barely have any time for myself and gaming, but I would definitely do it if I could.\n\nSo don't think about the age difference but rather how you both enjoy the game. Make the game the main reason you both talk to each other. And like any relationship, the more you get to know each other, the more comfortable you'll feel talking about personal stuff and it won't feel weird at all.\n\nYou seem like a good person by taking the age gap into account. That to me means you CARE about the well being of the kiddo and wouldn't do anything dangerous, so if you ever feel like trying, go ahead! You may change that kid's perspective on life in a good way, and make them realize gaming for kids is not the toxic environment a lot of modern gaming seems to conceptualize.",

Shot it down really hard and told her \u201cI can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to do that, you are 15 and I am an adult, you need to be hanging out with friends your age\u201d lmfao. Luckily she understood and actually thanked me for just trying to look out for her.\n\nThere isn\u2019t anything inherently weird playing online games with kids. We were in their shoes once, a lot of them are just looking for people to play with and I just remember how soul crushing it was when people found out I was a teenager/kid and suddenly ceased interaction. I do think you made a good call not wanting to do voice chat, and if you\u2019re not comfortable playing games with them either way you should tell them. You\u2019d be surprised how much kids internalize their interactions online and how they treat others as a result",
