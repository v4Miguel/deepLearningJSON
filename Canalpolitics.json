So I guess I'll post it here:\n\n\nAs a former Republican from Texas, can I please say:\n\nThey don't want your guns. Obama was born in America. There were no emails for crooked Hillary, nor were there Mexican gangs roaming the suburbs. There was no Antifa attack. There is no laptop. And there is no voter fraud. \n\nHow many times can someone cry wolf here? They pulled these tactics when I was voting for Bush and it never led anywhere.\n\nThere was, however, an investigation that led to multiple Presidential staffers and campaign managers being given prison time for their involvement in the 2016 campaign. \n\nWhy don't Republicans care about this?\n\nThe only thing the last administration did was give massive tax cuts to corporations, sever our control on a global scale, and undermined our democracy.\n\nThis is not the Republican party I grew up with. This has been a sham and a tarnish on what used to be a party that stood on Christian morals and values. The party has thrown their character to the wind.\n\nThe Republican party lost its way when it embraced the misguided lies and got away from policy. I haven't voted Republican in years, but the party has only sank further and further from what it used to be.\n\nI actually hope you guys get it together, as diverse opinions are the embodiment of democracy. I know this will be deleted but I had to get it off my chest. \n\nI really want us to work together again.\n\n\nEdit: link for support https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-bannon-associates-factbox-idUSKBN25G1YU",

They have two years to offer an extremely stark contrast against Trump's presidency. If they get a lot of meaningful change done, the vacuum left in Trump's absence might actually persuade some of his supporters to realize \"oh wow, I really was conned, my life really *is* significantly better under Democratic leadership.\" I can only think that's the case because Trump had a ton of support from non-voters who aren't necessarily Republicans. So they won't default to automatically voting for Republican in 2022 or 2024.\n\nThe things that the Democrats offer have to really be meaningful for the working class, though. If poor Mississippians finally feel like their lives are improving, they can be won over. If the focus is only on things that appeal mainly to big-city voters, the Republicans will win big again. It's not that I don't support things like trans protections, for example, and I think meaningful positive change is needed there, but I hope that at some point, there's a realization that so many of Trump's voters weren't conservative or Republican, they were desperate and struggling lower-class workers who have felt abandoned. Some of them have never met a trans person in their life. That's not to dismiss the fight for trans rights by any means, but those Trump voters *can* be won over, despite what it may seem, by having someone fight for their economic interests and give them a leg up. Now is the time to just fucking go for it and try to win back some of the voters that Trump really let down.",

We need to focus funding on education and not the absurd amount we procure for defense spending. We need to educate these fuck-gloves or we're going to see this nonce-sense again and again. I'm a Private Military Consultant focusing in Foreign Military Sales; currently for the Army, but past clients have been the Navy and DISA (Defense Information Systems Agency) - I'm disgusted and disappointed. I wanted to be a patriot and serve in the military but was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and thusly turned away - so I settled for a civilian avenue of serving this shit-wagon for the last ten years. Again, I'm so tired, and no matter how many anecdotes read in the house tonight from greater men and women stemming from a harsher or more decadent years - I saw domestic terrorism, and the hope I had this morning was clearly na\u00efve. Fuck it and fuck you.\n\nGuys, despite my name username, I've had very little hope for much and for so long. Today really is something to be thankful for and I'm actually hopeful for a possible change. I'm definitely keeping my expectations low because my cynical presumptions are so strong. I'm so tired.

                "comment": "Let's all remember:\n\n**I'm not so sure he ever wanted to be President.** He looked like his [dog died](http://i.imgur.com/7WB763p.jpg) on election day. (Except you'll have to picture someone who likes dogs) Melania [broke down in tears](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html?gtm=bottom). (reportedly not good ones, although she denied it)\n\nCohen testified before Congress and said [he never wanted to win](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/431802-cohen-trump-described-his-campaign-as-the-greatest-infomercial-in-political) - that he saw the primaries and election as a marketing strategy for him.\n\n>\"Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great,\" Cohen told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee. \"He had no desire or intention to lead this nation, only to market himself and to build his wealth and power.\"\n\n>\"Mr. Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the greatest infomercial in political history,\" Cohen said in his opening remarks. \"He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity.\"\n\n[Trump Tower Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_Moscow) is another curious element. It was a project that Trump, Cohen, and Giuliani consistently lied about, and that Cohen was even charged over. Despite conflicts of interest and political ramifications (something a potential candidate would be very wary of pursuing), the project was pursued up until June, 2016. Talks dissolved as the election neared and Trump's political chances and exposure grew.\n\nIt doesn't seem too far-fetched to suggest that ever since election night, we've been witnessing what a narcissistic reality TV show host and casino owner (with ZERO political experience) would do if they **accidentally won the presidency.** \n\nPainfully enough, we're also seeing what the GOP and 40% of the nation would do in this scenario straight out of TheOnion.\n\nIronically, he now has incentive to stay President because it is the only thing shielding him from indictments. Cohen is literally in prison for crimes Trump directed, evidenced in no uncertain terms by SDNY as \"Individual-1\". There are at least 4 open-and-shut OOJ charges that would result in indictments, [according to 1,000 federal prosecutors.](https://www.newsweek.com/former-federal-prosecutors-trump-indicted-wasnt-president-1439716) The Ukraine saga that has led to his impeachment could very well be explained partly because he will do anything to stay out of prison (AKA - winning 2020).\n\nWe haven't even seen the tip of the iceberg of his financial crimes, despite knowing him and his family [defrauded the government of $400 million](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html) for decades. He also [lost more than a billion dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=27AE398E38DC3D72B25FC7C9355C6E51&gwt=pay&assetType=REGIWALL) in the 80's and 90's.\n\nJust think about it: He promised to release his tax returns in the campaign, only to do a 180 and *appeal three separate cases all the way to the Supreme Court*. This is not a man who ever wanted the microscope and scrutiny of becoming President.\n\nIt's insane to think that 40% of the nation and the GOP have a cult-like following around a person who honestly might be trapped and desperately never wanted to be where he is. Luckily for him, he's a self-obsessed businessman devoid of empathy or integrity who has been bullshitting people his entire life. Otherwise, he might not be able to keep this charade up.\n\nWhen all the dust settles, future historians are going to have a hell of a time writing about this period. I can picture them now - combing through tweets and absurd public statements. I feel like any teachers trying to cover this time are going to have to constantly remind students \"Yes, I promise this really happened.\"",

In case anyone wasn\u2019t able to watch the live debates this evening, Adam Schiff delivered the quote of this century which deserves its place in history. \n\n\nAdam Schiff waited patiently as John Ratcliffe delivered fire and brimstone against the Democrats, the Unfair Process, the Unnamed Whistleblower, and then cooly laid a fucking poetic sledgehammer and leveled every Republican response, in one line:\n\nRep John Ratcliffe, (R) Texas:   \u201cHistory will remember this day as the day the Democrats impeached the president for nothing more than spite.\u201d\n\nAdam Schiff, (D) California;   **\u201dMadam Speaker, I think when the history of this time is written, it will record that when my colleagues found they lacked the courage to stand up to this unethical president, they consoled themselves by attacking those who did.\u201d**\n\nSchiff is a uniquely gifted orator. These 39 words will be immortalized in history as one sentence which so brilliantly and concisely summarized the willing, blindful, repugnant actions of the GOP, offset by the Democrats trying to ballast our democracy by impeaching this dangerous and corrupt president.\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n**Edit**: Voting in 2018 made this happen. People were pissed, and disgusted, and exasperated, by the direction the country had gone under full republican control in *less than* 2 years. \n\nAt that time I wasn\u2019t sure if I was registered to vote, then listened to a podcast of Pod Save America (plugging them because I learn more from this podcast than any other on politics) they lead me to this link:\n\nhttps://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/\n\nFolks, if you\u2019re not sure if you are registered, or even if you are sure, just take the 30 seconds to confirm if you are registered to vote. And if you aren\u2019t, well here ya go:\n\nhttps://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote\n\n**Edit 2** Also adding the link to fair fight. \n\nThis is the initiative Stacey Abrahms has initiated to protect voter registration rights, to stop funny business from unscrupulous voting suppression shenanigans the GOP has been deploying - thanks fellow Redditer for he suggestion. \n\n\nhttps://fairfight.com/\n\n**Edit 3**  **(my favorite edit ever)**\n\n*A fellow Redditer sent me a message just now, informing me they registered to vote, from the link I attached above. That is the best fucking result I\u2019ve received of any single post I\u2019ve ever submitted. Beats all the cool blings and upvotes and cool comments I\u2019ve received on my two years on Reddit.

In some districts turnout was as high as 60%, and some districts had higher turnout than during the last presidential election. [**1**](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/08/665197690/a-boatload-of-ballots-midterm-voter-turnout-hit-50-year-high)\n\nDemocrats gained 40 seats in the House of Representatives. [**2**](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-house-elections.html)\n\nDemocrats also picked up seven governorships in 2018, and two more in 2019, in [Kentucky](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/elections-kentucky-mississippi-test-trump-s-political-power-n1075581) and [Louisiana](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/louisiana-gov-john-bel-edwards-wins-re-election-blow-trump-n1084236).

In the states where Democrats did not get outright control of the state legislature, they were able to, in most cases, break Republican super-majorities. [**4**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-gain-hundreds-of-legislative-seats-and-secure-majority-of-state-attorneys-general/2018/11/07/cef1ebd6-e2aa-11e8-ab2c-b31dcd53ca6b_story.html?utm_term=.b23c5dc69e34) And in 2019, Democrats took full control of the [Virginia](https://apnews.com/87ba998f09fd43359011e64fe0e68ad2) state house for the first time since 1994.\n\nAgain, voting matters.\n\nIf voting didn't matter, then Republicans in Arizona wouldn't have filed a lawsuit to prevent mail-in ballot counting in a very tight Senate race. [**5**](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/arizona-gop-sues-limit-mail-ballots-senate-race-n933866)\n\nIf voting didn't matter, then Republicans in Florida wouldn't have filed a lawsuit to prevent a recount in a very close governor and Senate race. [**6**](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/415852-scott-sues-broward-supervisor-of-elections-as-florida-senate-race-spirals)\n\nIn Georgia, voters actually had to file a lawsuit in order to get Brian Kemp to resign as Secretary of State, so he would not be overseeing voting counts and recounts in that state. Which is something he should have done over a month ago anyway in order to avoid conflicts of interest. [**7**](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/voters-file-lawsuit-to-stop-georgia-gov-candidate-kemp-from-overseeing-election.html)\n\nIf voting didn't matter, Georgia and Wisconsin wouldn't be attempting to purge 309,000 and 234,000 voters, respectively, from the rolls in their states. [**8**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/17/georgia-purged-voters-its-rolls-its-second-state-make-cuts-less-than-week/)\n\nBecause it bears repeating.\n\n>Democrat running against Mitch McConnell: [https://twitter.com/AmyMcGrathKY](https://twitter.com/AmyMcGrathKY)  \nDemocrat running against Lindsey Graham: [https://twitter.com/harrisonjaime](https://twitter.com/harrisonjaime)  \nDemocrat running against Elise Stefanik: [https://twitter.com/TedraCobb](https://twitter.com/TedraCobb)  \nDemocrat running against John Ratcliffe: [https://twitter.com/RussellFosterTX](https://twitter.com/RussellFosterTX)  \nDemocrat running against Mike Turner: [https://twitter.com/TimsDesiree](https://twitter.com/TimsDesiree)  \nThree Democrats running against Devin Nunes:  \n[https://twitter.com/PhilArballo2020](https://twitter.com/PhilArballo2020)  \n[https://twitter.com/bobbybliatout](https://twitter.com/bobbybliatout)  \n[https://twitter.com/daryrezvani](https://twitter.com/daryrezvani)  \n[Three Democrats](https://oberlinreview.org/19854/news/democratic-candidates-look-to-defeat-rep-jordan-in-4th-congressional-district/) running against Jim Jordan.\n\nIf I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times: **voting matters**.

At one point, I strongly considered that pursuing Impeachment might be the wrong move, ONLY because of the GOP majority in the senate that almost guarantees he will not be removed. But, sometime in the last week, my view really cemented: this is the right move.\n\nEven though removal is unlikely, this is still an indelible stain on the record of his presidency. 5 or fewer presidents have been Impeached. I phrase it that way because some people count Nixon and some don't, since I seem to recall he resigned before the impeachment vote. Regardless, this stage of Impeachment is exceedingly rare, and a definite statement about the level of faith our countrymen and their representatives are willing to grant to the executive. It is extremely important that some permanent record be made denoting that a LARGE part of our country absolutely does not support Trump's actions and behaviour.\n\nAmerica and her people are putting up as much resistance as they can against this regime, and our CHECKS and BALANCES give us better avenues to do so than most nations before. To use a trite comparison, Nazi Germany never Impeached Hitler. This vote shows the will of at least one powerful part of those CHECKS and BALANCES against the executive standing up to it and saying \"no.\"\n\nAs a final thought, I will mention my general belief that the right thing to do is always the right thing to do. One shouldn't ONLY do the right thing because it is the move that wins; it is sufficient simply to be decisively in the right. I fully believe that our American system of governance is one of, if not THE, best in our world's history, and I am glad that at least one of our parties and the branch they control are willing to protect it strongly.",

If you offer a cop $20 to get out of a traffic ticket, even if he declines, you have still committed bribery\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 4: Abuse of power is not even a crime. \n\nResponse: Impeachable conduct may be criminal conduct, but need not be. A president could be impeached if he watched TV all day and failed to fulfill his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 5: There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking for an investigation. \n\nResponse: If this were legitimate investigation, you wouldn\u2019t need to send your personal lawyer and his henchmen to do it. Witnesses say Trump didn\u2019t want investigation, just announcement of investigation.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 6: There was no quid pro quo. \n\n[Response:] Read the transcript! Trump\u2019s request for a \u201cfavor\u201d is strong evidence, corroborated by witness testimony, of months-long scheme to get Zelensky to \u201cgo to the mic\u201d and announce Biden probe. Aid was leverage.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 7: As VP, Biden held up aid as leverage to get rid of the Ukrainian public prosecutor. \n\nResponse: It is appropriate for a president or VP to take action to advance the interests of the nation. Trump was advancing his personal interests.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 8: Testimony is hearsay.\n\nResponse: Rules of Evidence don\u2019t apply. Also, call summary, Sondland testimony are non-hearsay. Trump has barred direct witnesses. You can\u2019t have it both ways. If they had information favorable to Trump, you can bet we would have heard from them.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 9: It happens all the time. Get over it. \n\nResponse: Trump sought foreign influence in our election and harmed national security by delaying aid designed to fight Russia, our adversary. We don\u2019t have to accept it. We deserve better.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 10: Impeachment would un-do an election. \n\nResponse: All impeachments un-do elections. Constitution permits impeachment if president is unfit to serve. When rigging an election is involved, elections are ineffective for removal. Impeachment is not to punish but to protect.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 11: Impeachment proceedings are moving too fast. \n\nResponse: This impeachment has moved slower than Bill Clinton\u2019s and on pace with Richard Nixon\u2019s. For a president who presents a clear and present danger to national security, removal is urgent and can\u2019t come soon enough\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nDefense 12: We need to hear from the whistleblower. \n\nResponse: The whistleblower was a tipster, whose tip led to the investigation. Tipsters do not testify at trial, the witnesses do. We have a duty to protect whistleblowers to encourage them to use proper channels to report abuse\"",

Put yourself in his shoes: If your goal is to continue the attack on the US, further create chaos drive the political divide, stir unrest, this could easily be accomplished by openly supporting Trump (provide refuge for Trump) and claim the US legal system mistreated him, that the US government is corrupt, and he was cheated. Trump voters/conservatives would lose further faith in the US government and systems, further radicalize them, and would find sympathy with Trump and view Putin more positively. \n\nTrump being the easily manipulated useful idiot that he is, would 100% go along with this. Plus he wants to avoid financial ruin and prison. So he really has no choice. \n\nThe icing on the cake will be the hard intelligence/national security secrets Trump would hand over. Despite him not really paying attention to intelligence reports or briefings, he still would certainly possess some level of classified/sensitive information about various things (US military readiness, national security, intelligence apparatus to some degree). You don't get a better asset than a former US President. \n\nPutin/Russia would absolutely love to have this information, and Trump would happily exchange it over for assurances of his freedom, resources, money, etc. Hell, Trump may even direct some of his staff (who flee with him) to gather more stuff to hand over. Odds are Putin is whispering this stuff into his ears right now, priming him to do so. The precedent has already been set as well. Yanukovych fled to Russia (and remains there now) when he was repudiated by Ukraine voters in 2014.",

The original was deleted but you can find various versions of the original flooding around at this time last year.\n\n***\n\nI really really hope this all ends with him arranging a summit with Putin in Moscow as a ruse for him to defect during his last months in office. That way it will be really hard for anyone to not reconcile with the fact that he is a self-interested coward.\n\nImagine Trump in Russia. For the first couple of months its the biggest story in the world. He does interviews on Russian State TV, talking about how the Deep State caused him to flee the country. Insisting he's still the President and he never really lost the election. \n\nBut then, slowly but as sure as the changing tide, fewer journalists are calling. Fewer requests for an interview. For a couple months he can still call up reporters and have what he says to them be newsworthy. But eventually they stop returning his calls. America and the world has moved on. He was a blip, a flash in the pan. He exposed deep wounds that the American people need to address. But he was a complication, not the original infection.\n\nNo one really wants to know what he has to say anymore. Because no ones cares.\n\nHe's now truly alone. In reality he has always been alone. He just hadn't realized it. Now he has regular contact with no one but his FSB bodyguards/handlers. He's stuck in a golden prison of his own making. He lives next to Yanukovych. But Viktor, being Ukrainian knows the culture and the language. Trump is never able to master anything but the ability to mumble some words that border on the incomprehensible in the language.\n\nHis days are spent in a unexceptional (in his eyes), dacha on the black sea. He's never far from the ever present sight of Russian Security Services. He lives off a modest Kremlin funded stipend. But domestic pressure is building on the United Russia Party to scale it back. He has no income of his own anymore. His assets are frozen and seized around the World.\n\nHis children are indicted. He didn't tell them of his plans to flee beforehand and they were as surprised as anyone. But, perhaps for the first time in their lives, Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric feel the curious absence of a pressure they can't explain. At first they can't figure it out. They each face years in prison yet they have never felt more free. They confide in each other and they soon realize that the weight lifted from their souls is that of their father.\nFree from his domineering presence they all plea to lesser charges. Putting the blame squarely on the narcissistic father whose \"Stockholm Syndrome\" like grip on them is slipping. They are sentenced. Don Jr. gets 18 months in Federal Prison. Ivanka and Jared are sentenced to staggered 12 month sentences. Eric cooperates fully and is not charged.\n\nThey are forbidden from contacting their father as part of their plea agreements. But they have no such desires. They don't care.\nMelania files for divorce almost immediately after his flight. She gains full custody of Barron in uncontested hearings. Her and her son are slowly spending more and more time in Slovenia. Eventually they relocate permanently. Melania and Barron split their time between Ljubljana and the French Riviera. Very sparingly visiting the States anymore. Her autobiography detailing the mental, emotional, and at times physical abuse she suffered becomes an international best seller. Trump's American passport has long since been revoked and the Slovene Government, as well as the EU, bans him from entry into the Schengen Area. He never sees, much less talks to them, again\nTrump becomes increasingly paranoid. He frequently tears his dacha apart looking for listening devices planted by Mossad, the Democrats, CIA, MI6 or whatever globalist conspiracy is hunting him this week. Soon he has no use for the teenage sex workers he has always fancied. Never having been a drinker, food becomes his only vice. He begins to put on weight. A lot of weight. As he slips into morbid obesity he nears 355 pounds.\n\nHe very often rants and raves at his bodyguards. His tenuous grip on reality is slipping. Some days he doesn't seem to know where he is. He is borderline catatonic on occasion. Spending days in his bedroom suite without leaving, only to eventually emerge in a fresh, albeit cheap and ill-fitting, suit. His wispy hair, long kept alive by the marvels of modern hair care technology, perfectly coiffed. During these fleeting moments of seeming sanity, he doesn't seem to remember much of the last decades. Believing himself to still be a pompous fixture of the New York real estate scene. He once even asked his handlers how the New Jersey Generals were fairing this season.\n\nBut within two or three days he is once again disheveled and ranting about the Deep State. His speech becoming more slurred and incomprehensible by the year. A series of strokes leaves his body partially paralyzed on one side. He now requires round the clock nursing. Incontinence soon follows.\n\nEventually he's found on the floor of his dacha, face down in a puddle of his own vomit. He is discovered by the morning nurse as she begins her shift. His breathing is slow, his heart rate is faint. He never again regains consciousness. He looks to have collapsed at some point in the night. During a mad, partially paralyzed slog to the bathroom in a vain attempt to avoid soiling his bed once again.\n\nThe official cause of death is a heart attack. Which is likely true but having outlived his usefulness, the Russian government has long since seen him as an embarrassing liability. His asylum has been a sticking point in relations with the West for years and conspiracy theories alleging his assassination at the hands of the FSB or CIA abound.\nThe Russians offer to repatriate his remains. Although his family, while not outright refusing, is lukewarm to the prospect. They have moved on. Barron and Tiffany don't even use his surname anymore. Unable to find a solution, the Russians bury him in a modest grave. It was originally planned to be temporary but a long term solution never comes to fruition. Before too long everyone has forgotten.\nIn death he remains infamous. His name uttered in the same breath as other embarrassing episodes of American History. Some infinite presidents are recognized for the disasters they got us into like the Iraq war and the Vietnam war, but Trump managed to kill far more Americans than that by simple incompetence. A quarter of a million people died as a result of his ego, and then close to that many died the following year while the country worked to sort out the mess he left behind and get the virus under control.\n\nIn US History textbooks he is relegated to a few paragraphs. Not more than half a page in the section on politics. In fact he has mentioned far more in the discussion of disasters that hit the United States than on any sort of political achievements - because he didn\u2019t actually achieve anything, he simply failed to act based on his own arrogance. And that\u2019s all he\u2019s remembered for. He's brought up in conjunction with a wider discussion on the Political gridlock of the late 2000s, 2010s and early 20s. In the end, he is nothing more than the answer to a few multiple choice questions on an 11th Grade History Final. His legacy once seemed destined to be that of a pompous, arrogant game show host and real estate fraudster. Nothing but a textbook example of that which one would describe as \"tacky\".\n\nNow he is simply: \"What was the name of the President attributed to the largest preventable disaster in American history?\u201d\n\nThe answer is \"(C) Donald J. Trump\"",

It is achieved by predominantly playing to the uneducated and shallow thinking masses, and keeping them from being educated in critical thinking.\n\nUmberto Eco speaks of ur-fascism (a generic right wing dictatorship complimentary to but different than fascism). He also has fourteen characteristics of fascism in his essay Ur-Fascism and also stated **\"it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it\".**\n\nhttps://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf\n\n2 problems with the DHS response in Portland:\n\n1. Anticipatory arrests are prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n2. Non-custodial arrests are prohibited under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nViolations of the 4^th and 14^th amendments.\n\nJames Waterman Wise Jr. said, in February of 1936, when fascism comes to the US \"it will probably be \u201cwrapped up in the American flag and heralded as a plea for liberty and preservation of the constitution.\u201d\n\n3 of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here(Lawrence Britt Spring 2003 based upon the article \"The Hallmarks of Fascist Regime\" by Skip Stone):\n\n* **Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights**\n\nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n * **Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause**\n\nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  \n\n* **Obsession with Crime and Punishment**\n\n**Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism.**There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\nhttps://www.favreau.info/misc/14-points-fascism.php\n\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/two-dhs-officials-apparently-just-admitted-their-troops-have-been-violating-the-constitution/\n\n1 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here\n\n* **Fraudulent Elections**\n\nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. **Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.**\n\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/07/11th-circuit-florida-fines-fees-judicial-ethics.html\n\n2 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here\n\n* **Religion and Government are Intertwined**\n\nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n* **Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts**\n\nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\n\nhttps://www.salon.com/2020/07/13/dr-john-gartner-donald-trump-is-the-most-successful-bio-terrorist-in-human-history/\n\n2 more of the 14 points of fascism demonstrated here\n\n* **Corporate Power is Protected**\n\nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n* **Rampant Cronyism and Corruption**\n\nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\nhttps://www.salon.com/2020/07/13/dr-john-gartner-donald-trump-is-the-most-successful-bio-terrorist-in-human-history/\n\n\n* Fascist Review:\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-25/portland-finally-proves-it-trump-is-pulling-us-into-fascism\n\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-is-donald-trump-a-fascist-1.8913249\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trumps-fascist-performance\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-fascism-george-floyd-protests-washington-dc-a9546941.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Luu1Beb8ng",

They can't just be officially classified as a terrorist group.\n\nI doubt many people that signed the petition actually understand what this designation means and how it's used. Likely, it simply sounds good to them to designate the KKK as a terrorist group because fuck the KKK.",

In my 30 years the only time I've seen a klansman come out of the woods was on Jerry Springer and Im pretty sure he was just an actor. I certainly believe the Klan deserves to be labeled a \"hate group\" by the ADL but until the start burning crosses in people's front yards again I don't think the label terrorist applies. What they do now out in the woods now is not much different from some weird occult cult activity, its not like their sacrificing black babies out there or anything and I'm pretty sure the feds have agents implanted in their ranks so we would know about it if they did. \n\nMy fear is that pushing these people even further when we've already driven them out of society with social pressure will only lead to them taking violent actions once again. They already believe they are losing \"their country\" to POC and the Jews. If we start prosecuting them as terrorists without due cause that will only strengthen their beliefs that they are being persecuting and will only radicalize them further. If they are content with going out in the woods, burning a few crosses, chanting, then getting drunk and having a bbq then frankly I'm happy where they're at. \n\nI'm actually a big fan of Daryl Davis, the black musician who goes to these klan rallies and befriends the members. I believe the only way to get people to stop believing in the klan is to show them they are wrong, not using the force of the law. You can't legislate people's beliefs, but you can show them they are wrong.",

Had we treated 911 as a crime rather than a terrorist act, we wouldn't have entered into decades of war in the middle east under false pretenses. And we wouldn't have allowed innocent people to be imprisoned in Guantanamo for decades.

The FBI has admitted to being aware of all of this, and yet has refused to ever condemn the KKK or other white supremacists groups as the terrorists organizations they are.\nInstead, they have spent their resources on attempting to brand groups like BLM and ANTIFA as dangerous terrorist group, even going as far as to keep surveillance on members of those groups for years. \nPredictably, they have consistently failed to find any discernible threat with these groups, but have come out and begrudgingly said that the deadly threats they have regularly happened upon have nearly ALL been white supremacist-related. Some they are able to stop, and others become the latest mass shooting splashed across the news. \n\nMeanwhile, a number of black organization members and leaders have turned up dead under extremely suspicious circumstances.

The article says, \"Theoretically, the number could shrink with more tallying underway, but Biden's lead is expected to continue going up,\" which was already true on Saturday, and \"Biden is now up by 50,000 votes, which means that even if Trump's legal team is successful in getting courts to toss out 10,000 votes received between Election Day and Nov. 6, there's little chance they could actually alter the results,\" which doesn't pertain to the notion of an automatic recount.\n\n2) The [NYT data scraper](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html#) estimates that there are 32,000 votes left to be counted in Pennsylvania. Biden's win margin is currently about 51,000 votes. If all the remaining votes went to Trump, Trump would trail by 19,000 votes, or about 0.3% of the total, which would trigger an automatic recount. Trump hasn't passed any new threshold in relation to recounts.",

They are nice for walks and reflection. The history and meaning of those places, the death, struggle, pain, suffering, commradery, and sorrow is something that every American should experience. But I am often disappointed in my fellow countrymen that the fields and woods are often empty, long forgotten and discarded. Sacrifices made and blood spilled not honor, not mourned, not remembered.\n\nBut what is always at the forefront of people's mind, the \"history,\" is those stupid fucking statues on monument avenue. Those great leaders up on their horses. Those same men that sold lies to my ignorant ancestors, who were denied schooling, reading, writing, voting, and instead were told to work the land for mere penitence of their worth. They used them as cannon fodder and told them lies about the Yankees coming for their rights. Those men should be torn down or moved to the battlefields. Maybe then people would go and see and feel and hear those battles of brothers against one another. \n\nBut, I think not unfortunately.\nThey are really just buying into the old story of lost cause and the grand old south. Much like my family has done. Even with the knowledge that the landed gentry class manipulated  our ancestors to fight a battle that would continue to hold them down, they still believe in \"states rights\" , \"war of nothern agression\"  and whatever other crap they call it.\nMy family has been dirt floor poor white trash for ever until the last 50 years when we made it to the middle class and they still want to celebrate those men that help keep us down for so long. I hang my head in shame, but I celebrate these new laws that will tear down this legacy that has put a stain on the south.",
