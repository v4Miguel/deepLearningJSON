        "description": "**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We\u2019re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.\nHead over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**\n\n**WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING?**\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\n**WHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY?**\nNet neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\n**WHY VERIZON STORES?**\nThe new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\n**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**\nAjit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\n**HOW CAN I JOIN?**\n[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",

Basically makes it easier to contact congress with personalized faxes (which I'm told are more effective than emails, though perhaps less than phone calls).\n\nStep 1: Text Resist to 50409\n\nStep 2:\n\nYou'll need to set it up with your address so it knows who to fax.\n\nOnce that's done, reply 'congress'\n\nStep 3:\n\nWrite out a note. I suggest being kind, but firm, with positive expectations. (e.g. don't write it as if you expect them to do the wrong thing, because then this reduces the downside of doing the wrong thing!)\n\nCongress isn't directly involved - but they can stop the FCC. And so you can ask them to stop the FCC.\n\nUnique messages are better, that's why I'm not including a script to write. (I've read that if multiple people say the same thing, they just read it once, and then key it in as something like 'Form letter, 1000 submissions' whereas with unique faxes they are required to read them all.) You can make it short, just a few sentences if you want.\n\nStep 4:\n\nText 'done'\n\nStep 5:\n\nThat's it.\n\n**Option 2 - Free, slightly more time**\n\nAlternatively, call: https://www.battleforthenet.com/\n\nAlso \"Call the FCC at 888-225-5322. It'll take you through a few options, but you can talk to real person to make a formal complaint against Ajit Pai's plan.\" (Thanks drkgodess)",

The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**\n\nWe're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won\u2019t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.\n\n**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.\n\nTo reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.\n\nWhen you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: \n> I support \"Title Two\" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.\n\nWe also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join\n\nThanks.",

If an intern gets off the call with you and you didn't give them either of those things, there's not much she can do and your opinion can't really be officially logged. If you need to, **ask if they accept email in place of street address**.\n\n2) Be nice to the interns. Please.\n\n3) Make sure you're calling the right rep.

I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this matter. \n  \nOver the past two decades, Americans have increasingly relied on the Internet in their personal and professional lives, and new technologies play a central role in the Internet\u2019s growing importance. Many of these technologies have been developed in Texas. As Texans and Americans, we all benefit from advancements that encourage economic growth and make day-to-day life easier. \n  \nWe need policies to meet the evolving challenges of technological advancement. However, government regulations move slower than technology, and we must ensure the laws we pass do not stifle innovation. A top-down regulatory approach can unnecessarily constrain an industry\u2019s ability to create and deliver new products and services to market. In the Senate, I have supported laws that facilitate innovation and opposed those which threaten it. For example, I supported the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (P.L. 112-29), which modernized our outdated patent system by improving the application process and reducing litigation. \n \nAs you may know, on May 18, 2017, the FCC voted 2-1 to pass the \u201cRestoring Internet Freedom\u201d Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM). The NPRM intends to replace the regulatory structure of the 2015 Open Internet Order, commonly referred to as Net Neutrality, with a light-touch regulatory framework that protects consumers, closes the digital divide and brings next-generation networks and services to all Americans. The successful vote opened a two month comment period on how to best maintain a free and open Internet. If you wish to file your comments on the NPRM with the FCC, you may do so here: https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs . The deadline for submitting comments is July 17, 2017. \n \nI support the FCC\u2019s transparent approach to reduce burdensome regulation and improve internet access and services. I am also proud to cosponsor the Restoring Internet Freedom Act (S. 993). This legislation would nullify the net neutrality rule, ensure Congress maintains its primary authority to reshape communications policy, and restore the competitive freedom that has characterized the Internet. S.993 has been referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Although I am not a member of this Committee, I will be sure to keep your views in mind should S. 993 be considered by the full Senate during the 115th Congress.\n \nI appreciate the opportunity to represent Texas in the United States Senate. Thank you for taking the time to contact me. \n \nSincerely, \n \nJOHN CORNYN \nUnited States Senator \n",

They mainly use the Internet for Facebook and Netflix. They had no idea about the FCC or what is going on in the world. Why? because that's how life is for most people. They have their SO & possibly family and that's all they want. The people at the top know this as well which is why it won't change. If you really want to show these kinds of people true change.

We live in Manhattan and we're all from the Northeast. We have limited exposure to parts of the country that is not Los Angeles, Chicago, or the ski towns in the Rockies.  We perhaps have a different lifestyle than rural Tennessee/Smoky Mountains.\n\nHaving said that, we had **THE BEST** time at Dollywood.  We went with a certain prejudiced and preconceived notion of what it would be like.   While my kids didn't understand why so many people were riding mobility scooters and were a little shocked at how much larger the people were .... yes, there are big people everywhere, but the proportion of big people to not so big people was very high.\n\nThe park was so clean, people were so nice, the lines were manageable, the food was amazing for an amusement park.  It was one of the more memorable experiences of my kids' childhood.",

                "comment": " Pretty much all artists believe their art is automatically copyrighted the instant it's completed and protected from acts of infringement-- and they're right, it is. According to United States Copyright Law, and quoting from the copyright.gov website, your art is considered copyright protected from \"the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\" Sounds like everything's peachy and you're covered, right? Not so fast.\n\nYes, your art is automatically copyrighted, but believing that no further action is necessary in terms of formally registering it with the United States Copyright Office can be a major mistake. According to Copyright Law, formally registering works of art is far more advantageous over not registering them in several very substantial ways. Before getting into specifics here, be aware that only certain types of art are likely to be infringed upon. Most art has little or no appeal to infringers. Why? Because infringers almost always do what they do to make money, and tend to only steal images that are capable of generating income in one way or another. However the opposite can also take place-- where infringers take images to use on websites or in film sets where the benefits or profit potential may be less straightforward. No matter what the circumstances, the broader the appeal of your art and the easier your imagery and compositions are for people to recognize, understand and appreciate (and appropriate), the more concerned you should be about registering them. This is especially true if your images are so attractive that people actively attempt to take and display them in various ways.\n\nNow should all artists register every single work of art they create? Not really. In fact, few artists are truly at risk, especially those who produce more abstract or conceptual works, art with substantial cognitive components, art that's difficult and nonproductive from monetary standpoints to copy or reproduce, and art with limited commercial appeal. The basic question you should ask yourself is this-- \"Am I vulnerable to someone taking my art, copying and reproducing it in a big way and making lots of money?\"\n\nThe artists who have to be most concerned about infringement are those whose images or designs have somewhat of a mass or commercial appeal, and are easy and conducive to being copied-- particularly onto other mediums such as T-shirts, coffee mugs, shoes, bags, skateboards, or similar types of mass-produced merchandise that have the potential to be salable across wide ranges of the population. Having a large online following may be a determining factor as well. Also vulnerable is art with creatures, characters or settings that could conceivably be \"borrowed\" and replicated in films, animation, comics or video games... or even in the work of other artists. Having a large online following may be a determining factor as well. If you've got a respectable fan base and make art with any of these characteristics or components, registering the copyrights is generally recommended.\n\nAnother indication that copyrighting your art would be a good idea is if you've developed a particular type of look or composition or subject matter that is identified as being uniquely yours, especially if it's becoming increasingly popular with collectors. Although you can't register \"style\" itself, you can register any number of works of art that are done in your own unique style. This protects you against infringers who decide to copy one or more of them for their own personal benefits. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, they say, but if it begins to detract from your bottom line, then defending your interests will likely become necessary at some point. And the sooner you recognize that a possibility exists for appropriating and capitalizing on your artworks, the better.\n\nSo OK-- let's get started. Why go through the process of formally copyrighting your art? Four basic reasons:\n\n1. Suppose someone reproduces some aspect or characteristic of your art without your permission. If the art was not registered prior to the infringement, you are limited to the infringer's profits as your damages. For example, if an infringer prints your art on T-shirts, sells 500 of them and makes a clear profit of $10 per shirt, you're limited to that $5000 profit as the amount you can recover (if that $5000 profit is before costs, your limitation will be even less-- that is, whatever profit remains after subtracting all costs of production). If on the other hand, you have registered the art, you are entitled to \"statutory damages\" of up to $150,000 per willful infringement, and you can elect to take that instead of actual damages (a clear choice in our hypothetical T-shirt example). Statutory damages are punitive in nature, but only available as an option to you if you register the copyrights on art before the infringement.\n\n2. If the art is registered prior to the infringement, then in addition to statutory damages, the court is authorized to award you attorney's fees plus other incidental costs of litigation. You are not entitled to obtain a judgment that includes these costs or fees if the art was not registered prior to the infringement.\n\n3. If a work of your art is infringed on and it's not registered, you have to go ahead and register it anyway before you can bring a copyright action in federal court (file a federal case). So you see, you aren't saving anything by not registering it in advance-- it has to be registered regardless if you intend to take legal action; registration is a procedural requirement in that regard.\n\n4. Registering your art in advance of an infringement proves prima-facie that you created the image when you say you did. In other words, the registration documents constitute sufficient evidence to prove the art was created before the infringement. Without a prior registration, the date of creation could be contested; the infringers could maintain that you actually created it later than you did. So it all shakes out like this... With prior registration, the burden of proof is on the infringer to demonstrate that they created their work either before or independently of you creating yours. Without prior registration, the burden of proof is on you to demonstrate that you created the work first, and that they willfully appropriated it for their own purposes without your consent. That's a huge difference.\n\nFor these reasons, attorneys are far more likely to take infringement cases on a contingency fee basis when the art has been registered prior to the infringements. Resolving claims on registered works of art is always easier for attorneys and copyright holders because the documented prior registration constitutes conclusive proof that the creation of the art predated the infringement. Attorneys have far greater leverage moneywise as well, particularly in terms of being able to seek statutory damages and be reimbursed for their fees. On the flip side, attorneys tend to avoid cases involving unregistered art, especially on a contingency basis, because not only is the total award limited to amount of profit made by the infringers, but without prior registration, proving the creation of the art predated the infringement can also get complicated. Either the amount of profit made by infringers has to be large enough for attorneys to consider taking a case on a contingency basis or they will expect you to pay their costs and fees out-of-pocket as the case progresses.\n\nWhether you decide to register your art or not, the least you can do is to make your copyright clear to everyone concerned. Place a notice on your website that all images are copyright protected. This notice should include the copyright symbol (c), the year (very important) and your name. Place copyright notices on each individual work of art as well (you can do this either on the front, or on the back if you feel the notices might in some way clash with the compositions).\n\n [https://www.artbusiness.com/register\\_and\\_copyright\\_art\\_for\\_artists.html](https://www.artbusiness.com/register_and_copyright_art_for_artists.html)",

Robyn F. picked up Brown's cellular phone and observed a three-page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.\n\nA verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.\n\nRobyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.\n\nBrown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'\n\nThe detective said \"Robyn F.\" then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer.\n\nRobyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'\n\nAfter Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!'\n\nBrown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown.\n\nBrown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand.\n\nRobyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.\n\nBrown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.\n\nBrown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it.\n\nBrown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness.\n\nShe reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions.\n\nRobyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.",

        "description": "Article: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kylies-17-minute-flight-has-nothing-on-the-170-trips-taylor-swifts-private-jets-took-this-year-1390083/\n\nAs the world quite literally burns and floods, it\u2019s important to remember that individualism won\u2019t really solve the climate crisis, especially compared to, say, the wholesale dismantling of the brutal grip the fossil fuel industry has on modern society. Still, there are some individuals who could probably stand to do a bit more to mitigate their carbon footprint \u2014 among them, the super-wealthy who make frequent use of carbon-spewing private jets. (And let\u2019s not even get started on yachts.)\n\nWhile private jets are used by rich folks of all kinds, their use among celebrities has come under scrutiny recently, with reports of the likes of Drake and Kylie Jenner taking flights that lasted less than 20 minutes. In response, the sustainability marketing firm Yard put together a new report using data to rank the celebrities whose private jets have flown the most so far this year \u2014 and subsequently dumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. \n\nDrake and Jenner both appear on the list, but they\u2019re actually nowhere near the top, which is occupied by none other than Taylor Swift. According to Yard, Swift\u2019s jet flew 170 times between Jan. 1 and July 19 (the window for the Yard study), totaling 22,923 minutes, or 15.9 days, in the air. That output has created estimated total flight emissions of 8,293.54 tonnes of carbon, which Yard says is 1,184.8 times more than the average person\u2019s total annual emissions. (At least one more flight can be added to that list, too: The flight-tracking Twitter account Celebrity Jets notes that Swift\u2019s plane flew today, July 29.)\n\n\u201cTaylor\u2019s jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,\u201d a spokesperson for Swift tells Rolling Stone. \u201cTo attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.\u201d\n\nTo create this report, Yard scraped data from Celebrity Jets, which in turn pulls its info from ADS-B Exchange (\u201cthe world\u2019s largest public source of unfiltered flight data,\u201d according to its website). Yard based its carbon emissions estimates on a U.K. Department for Transportation estimate that a plane traveling at about 850 km/hour gives off 134 kg of CO2 per hour; that 134 kg estimate was multiplied with both time-spent-in-air and a factor of 2.7 to account for \u201cradiative forcing,\u201d which includes other harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide (2.7 was taken from Mark Lynas\u2019 book Carbon Counter). That number was then divided by 1000 to convert to tonnes. \n\nComing in behind Swift\u2019s plane on Yard\u2019s list was an aircraft belonging to boxer Floyd Mayweather, which emitted an estimated 7076.8 tonnes of CO2 from 177 flights so far this year (one of those flights lasted just 10 minutes). Coming in at number three on the list was Jay-Z, though his placement does come with a caveat: The data pulled for Jay is tied to the Puma Jet, a Gulfstream GV that Jay \u2014 the creative director for Puma \u2014 reportedly convinced the sneaker giant to purchase as a perk for the athletes it endorses.\n\nWhile Jay-Z is not the only person flying on the Puma Jet, a rep for Yard said, \u201cWe attributed the jet to Jay-Z on this occasion because he requested the Puma jet as part of his sign-up deal to become the creative director of Puma basketball. The Puma jet\u2019s tail numbers are N444SC at Jay-Z\u2019s request. N, the standard US private jet registration code, 444, referring to his album of the same name and SC for his birth name, Shawn Carter. Without Jay-Z, this jet would cease to exist.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the celebrities in Yard\u2019s top 10 do appear to own the jets that provided the flight data for the report. To that end, though, it\u2019s impossible to say if the specific owners are the ones traveling on these planes for every specific flight. For instance, Swift actually has two planes that CelebJets tracks, and obviously, she can\u2019t be using both at once.\n\nSo, beyond the Jay-Z/the Puma Jet, next on Yard\u2019s list is former baseball star Alex Rodriguez\u2019s plane, which racked up 106 flights and emitted 5,342.7 tonnes of CO2. And rounding out the top five is a jet belonging to country star Blake Shelton, which has so far taken 111 flights and emitted 4495 tonnes of CO2. The rest of the Top 10 includes jets belonging to director Steven Spielberg (61 flights, 4,465 tonnes), Kim Kardashian (57 flights, 4268.5 tonnes), Mark Wahlberg (101 flights, 3772.85 tones), Oprah Winfrey (68 flights, 3493.17 tonnes), and Travis Scott (54 flights, 3033.3 tonnes). \n\nReps for the other nine celebrities in the top 10 of Yard\u2019s list did not immediately return Rolling Stone\u2019s request for comment. \n\nAs for the two celebs who helped inspire Yard\u2019s study: Kylie Jenner\u2019s jet landed all the way down at number 19 (64 flights, 1682.7 tonnes), sandwiched between Jim Carey and Tom Cruise. And Drake\u2019s plane popped up at number 16 (37 flights, 1844.09 tonnes), in between golfer Jack Nicklaus and Kenny Chesney. While Jenner has yet to address her 17-minute flight, Drake did respond to some criticism on Instagram by noting that nobody was even on the seven-minute, 12-minute, and 14-minute flights his Boeing 767 took during a six-week span. The explanation, in all honesty, doesn\u2019t do him any favors.\n\n\u201cThis is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics\u2026 nobody takes that flight,\u201d Drake said. (A rep for Drake did not immediately return Rolling Stone\u2019s request for further comment.)",

This is not saying that all celebs should stop flying private (though for real, most totally could stop), rather, they can stand to do much less of it. This is not saying that these celebs are bad people, rather that they also need to practice what they preach (or at least some of them, the ones that recognize climate change and have spoken about it being bad, if they're climate change deniers this is probably fine in their eyes)\n\nWould this *solve* climate change? No, but it will help. Just like how governments and celebs ask us to \"do our part\", we need to keep those same people in check with the same statement, \"do your part\". Telling us to sacrifice our wellbeing to allow the rich and famous to live posh is not right, and neither is sacrificing their wellbeing, but a good number of these flights are possibly unnecessary and for luxury, not health, and so as they say, every little bit counts. Their impact is far far greater than most other people, so why not remove whole individual's carbon emissions for a year by taking a First Class flight once in a while rather than a private jet? A First Class flight in a plane with others is much more environmentally economical, and you still live to the posh image people have.",

In the end, the very last song WAAF played before the flip switched Friday night at midnight, was Black Sabbath by Black Sabbath.. WAAF has always supported you, and even I personally have been playing songs off the new album in anticipation of its release..

When Pearl Jam came to my hometown, I had a few different browsers pulled up on my computer and my phone waiting for them to go on sell at 10:00 am. Refreshed windows until I got the best available and got two tickets in the lower bowl of the arena. Not too bad for $160. The show sold out in 5-10 minutes.\n\nI contacted him to see what he got. Somehow he got 12 tickets in the best section of the arena and marked the price up almost 400% to sell them on stubhub.\n\nThese dudes have some kind of access that the general public does not. Anytime I\u2019ve asked him about it he\u2019s gotten real standoffish and is definitely not willing to disclose how he\u2019s able to do this consistently enough to make a living doing it. \n\n*Coincidently I\u2019m wearing the shirt that I bought at that concert.",

They are a team in Amsterdam that have built technology which allows artists to sell tickets directly to fans or people can use their own application to buy tickets. They are getting many events working with them and thanks to the blockchain technology they have developed it really puts an end to ticket touting. GUTS is used a lot in the Netherlands, with over 100k tickets being sold each year so far (1 Million by 2019). The protocol that powers the system which they have built called the GET protocol allows artists to sell tickets to their fans directly. The cryptocurrency GET powers the smart tickets which aim to get rid of ticket touting as they have several pieces of technology in place to prevent the re-selling of tickets but because of their awesome system it is very easy and non complicated, in fact to the ticket buyer there is no hints of blockchain or crypto as it is all handled in the background, which makes it perfect for everyone! The website is here: https://guts.tickets/. They act as both a B2B and B2C ticketing solution which is awesome as event companies can either choose to use the protocol and sell directly or use the already built application that GUTS has, as an investor of GET both ways benefit you as GET is always bought off the market when each ticket is created which helps build demand for the currency. There is also a buy back event that occurs where a % of all GET bought using the Event Organiser contract which is burnt! Some videos of GUTS in progress: https://vimeo.com/gutstickets I've written an article on GUTS here: https://decentralize.today/guts-revolutionizing-the-ticketing-industry-e07218a9c74d",

I explained how desperate I was and he kept me on the phone, refreshing the page on his computer constantly until it ticked over to 9am. All the time we chatted the screen said wait. As soon as 9am hit, he refreshed the page.\n\n\"Sold Out\"\n\nHe broke the news and sounded really apologetic. I asked how this could happen. We should literally have been one of the first to get a ticket. He put me on hold for all of 10 seconds.\n\n\"My manager told me he has had all of the tickets put aside for promotions. That means he will give out the tickets to radio shows, tv companies but more likely his friends, probably.\"\n\n\"It's a ten thousand seater venue, how many friends does he have?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ebay friends.\" He replied, sounding like this wasn't his first rodeo.\n\nI checked ebay straight after the phone call. The tickets were already up. They were starting at $200. This was nearly 20 years ago so adjusted for inflation and the fact I was a poor student that is around $16 million I think /s\n\nTake away from this is that I did not go to see the Smashing Pumpkins because of pride to not pay the touts... and my wallet said^nooooooo^way^son",

There are really two ways to solve this.  \n\n1)  Bands should be able to charge the actual market clearing price for their show. Best thing would be to use an auction, really. The fans with the most money who value the concert enough get to go. \n\nBUT Rock music, with its socialist aesthetic won't allow that so instead a bunch of sleazy middle men get involved. \n\nHow about we just stop the sleazy middle men?  Well then, besides being impossible, most fans *still* don't get to see their favorite bands because there is a *shortage*.  It's basically just putting in place a lottery.  Some random subset gets to see the band. But hey, at least the rich people aren't getting to buy their way to this totally non-essential luxury purchase even though totally non-essential luxury purchases is exactly what being rich *should* get you. (And does, with all the American Express Pre-Sales and bullshit)\n\nSo, instead, consider 2.  \n\n2) Bands could play more shows in each city.  That's right.  Want Pearl Jam tickets. Well, Pearl Jam is playing for three weeks at $20 a ticket. Everyone can go! No shortage! Yay!\n\nOh wait, except now there is a shortage of venues for artists to play in, and pearl Jam actually needs to work more to potentially make the same or less money. That seems to be an unlikely thing for most sellers to agree with. \n\ntl;dr  You're fucked. \n\n\n\n",

During this time, I was also working as a gogo dancer, and for Halloween that year, I got booked to perform at his show! Even though this wasn't a permanent fix for my depression, it did give me a chance to \"put off my death until I could dance for Avicii\".\n\nLeading up to the show, I kept the promise to myself, and I think it saved my life. Because after the show, somehow, I found the strength to get help. \n\nThanks for letting me part with you, Avicii! You had an incredible impact on my life. \u2665\ufe0f \n\nEdit: idk if that was inappropriate to post, but I just wanted to share how he made a positive impact on my life.

If you try it a second time at a later date and she doesn't pick up, don't worry, there is still a chance she was just busy again.

Robyn F. picked up Brown's cellular phone and observed a three-page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.\n\nA verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.\n\nRobyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'\n\nThe detective said Robyn F. then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer.Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.' After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!'\n\nBrown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown.\n\nBrown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand.\n\nRobyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it.\n\nBrown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness.\n\nShe reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions.\n\nRobyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.",

                "comment": "I encourage everyone in this sub to read the Police Report on his beating of Rihanna. It\u2019s disgusting. \n\n\nPolice report below, if anyone hasn't read it:\n\n\nChristopher Brown and Robyn F. (Rihanna) have been involved in a dating relationship for approx one and half years. On Sunday, February 8, 2009 at 0025 hours, Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F. as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robin F. picked up Brown\u2019s cellular telephone and observed a three page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with. A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit he took his right hand and shoved her head against the passenger window of the vehicle causing an approximate one inch raised circular contusion. Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F\u2019s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.\n\nBrown looked at Robyn F. and stated, \u201cI am going to beat the shit out of you when we get home! You wait and see!\u201d Robyn F. picked her cellular telephone and called her personal assistant, Jennifer Rosales at [redacted]. Rosales did not answer the telephone but while her voicemail greeting was playing, Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, \u201cI\u2019m on my way home. Make sure the cops are there when I get there.\u201d (This statement was made while the greeting was playing and was not captured as a message). After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown and looked at her and stated, \u201cYou just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I\u2019m really going to kill you.\u201d Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown. Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand. Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.\n\nBrown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular phone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand. Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of [redacted] and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it. Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F\u2019s. left and right carotid arteries causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness. She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gauge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown\u2019s body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet causing several contusions. Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.\u2019s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order (EPO).",
