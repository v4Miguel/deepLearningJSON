            "description": "Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!\n\n**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs\n\n**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Methodology/Steps**:\n\n* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.\n* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.\n* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:\n\n1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and\n2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.\n\n* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA’s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).\n* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search “\\[CITY\\] Strip Clubs” (e.g., “Detroit Strip clubs”). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...\n* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden’s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<\n\n>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<\n\n* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<\n\n>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<\n\n* >!This means that James Harden’s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city’s strip clubs !<\n\n>!Other interesting facts: !<\n\n* >!Harden’s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<\n* >!Harden’s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<\n* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Link to all my work](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hwDoaHcXqncb_l24NrxLCWTxE5pLaeKlU8r1Jnp39GQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe charts won’t upload perfectly to google docs so I have included [screenshots here](https://imgur.com/a/JEhHxkH)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ne. haha well this bl**e**w up. Just wanted to take the opportunity to say how much I appreciate r/NBA for being the best fucking sub on this site (**d**espite y'all nephews calling my boy *hitler*), than**k**s to all my fellow redditors for t**h**e nice words and the ridiculous amount of gold.",

            "description": "MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES SCOREKEEPER POSTING FRAUDULENT NUMBERS FOR DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR LEADER JAREN JACKSON JR. \n\nI would like to bring to your attention the scorekeeper of the Memphis Grizzlies.  I was wondering how a solid defensive player can suddenly have some specific statistical categories that are completely off the charts.  I am referring to Jaren Jackson Jr., who, after having missed ~16 games to start the season due to off-season foot surgery immediately started having extreme outlier high steals + blocks statistics, leading the entire NBA in blocks per game by a wide margin.  In fewer minutes per game than other players Jaron Jackson repeatedly gets outlandish block numbers at home. \n\nI decided to take a closer look at his games and IMMEDIATELY 1 thing became crystal clear.  At home in Memphis he has 66 blocks in 16 home games, averaging 4.13 blocks per game, versus just 35 in 16 road games, averaging 2.19 in nearly identical minutes- an 89% increase in Memphis.  In home games he has been credited with 22 steals in 16 home games, versus only 10 steals in 16 road games.  This means he is averaging nearly 1.4 steals per game at home, but just 0.63 steals on the road per game- an astounding 120% increase in Memphis.  In home games he has been credited with 88 blocks + steals, versus 45 on the road.  This equates to an average of an outlandish 5.5 blocks+steals at home in limited minutes versus a reasonable and realistic, and still outstanding, 2.81 steals+blocks per game on the road.  This equates to a 1.96X home stat increase only in these 2 categories.  A 96% increase in performance specifically at home is truly an aberration which should be reviewed.  This demonstrates the sort of incredulous statistics which calls for serious analysis. \n\nJust 3 out of his 14 games this season with 5+ blocks+steals have come on the road.  8 out of 9 of his 6+ steals+blocks games have been recorded in Memphis.  I decided to watch 2 memphis grizzlies games where he had one of his ludicrous 8+ blocks+steals games.  By my count he actually had 3 fewer \"stocks\"(some people refer to steals+blocks as stocks) than he was credited for by the home scorekeeper.  I wonder if the scorekeeper has some sort of vested interest in Jaren Jackson getting maximum high value defensive statistics that he thinks he can get away with putting down into the box score.  \n\nJaren Jackson in July - mid November started as high as +10,000 for DPOY at certain sportsbooks after the Grizzlies announced he had undergone a procedure to address a stress fracture in his right foot and would be sidelined for 4-6 months.  Now, in large part thanks to these blatantly wrong statistics, he is a huge odds on favorite at higher than -200. \n\nI conducted some analysis on all 78 games jaren jackson played last season... my hypothesis was that his home/road difference on steals & blocks would both be small.  He had 90 blocks in Memphis and 87 blocks on the road.  He had 39 steals in Memphis and 34 steals on the road.  He had 129 \"stocks\" in Memphis vs. 121 \"stocks\" on the road.  BPG was actually 12.7% lower on the road(he played 4 fewer home games) while steals+blocks/game was 15% lower on the road- higher than i expected, but reasonable given all the differences for Memphis when playing at home vs on the road, from their home/away record difference to crowd noise to effort/energy/intensity exerted by players, etc.\n90%+ higher in Memphis, however, as is the case this season, is NOT REASONABLE AND COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC.  My educated guess is that the Memphis scorekeeper(s) have been changed since last season and/or ULTERIOR MOTIVES, INCENTIVES are now in play with respect to JJJ's defensive statistics. \n\nWhy is this happening so blatantly to the point where a person can just look at Jaren Jackson Jrs. steals+blocks #s on the box score and determine with a high level of confidence whether that game was played on the road or in Memphis is the next question... \n\nThree potential explanations, only one of which is innocent: \n\n1. Jaren Jackson plays MUCH MUCH MUCH harder at home and hustles like a maniac and focuses on stealing and blocking shots like crazy in Memphis, causing his numbers to be skewed in an absurd manner even compared to his regular highly efficient top 3- but realistic, road numbers. This can almost certainly be discounted because i looked at his other statistics and everything from his minutes per game to points per game to rebounds per game and even fouls are close in terms of home/away splits. \n\n2. The Memphis scorekeeper is a huge Jaren Jackson Jr. fan and is purposely imbellishing his steals & blocks, since that is much easier to do than points or rebounds, for instance.  When he contests a shot well, but does not touch the ball, perhaps the scorekeeper purposely gives him the undeserved stat and donates blocks to him where none occurred, for instance. \n\n3. It should also be investigated in this age of fantasy basketball and gambling on sports whether this scorekeeper and/or his family and friends bet on Jaren Jackson to win the defensive player of the year award at super long odds and as a result has a tremendous financial incentive to juice and fake a player's 2 most valuable defensive statistics- BLOCKS and STEALS, which are also the easiest to fudge #s on because it is often most difficult to definitively label steals and blocks without slow motion on at least some of the plays in question. \n\nI and all NBA fans would appreciate a thorough investigation into this matter.  It is important to have 100% integrity in statistics not only for things such as fantasy sports, sportsbetting, futures wagers, but even more importantly to ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME FOR ALL.  This is mandatory to be able to compare players' statistics versus other players now in the league fairly as well as across seasons and know the numbers are accurate, correct, and not unfairly manipulated by home arena scorekeepers. \n\nI decided to watch just a few of the Grizzlies' recent games and immediately started noticing a pattern: Plays at FedEx arena in Memphis constantly being scored wrongly to gift Jackson extra steals and blocks which never occurred.  Simply put, if a shot does not hit the rim or it otherwise looks bad somehow, and Jaren Jackson is either contesting the shot or close to the action, he is credited with FRAUDULENT blocks repeatedly.  Sometimes this is achieved by taking away the stat from his teammates. Other times, an opposing player simply loses the ball or shoots a contested shot way off target, but Jackson nevertheless is credited with steals & blocks that never occurred in both instances.  Also, when he deflects a ball and it goes to a teammate he is credited with the steal.  When his teammate deflects the ball and it goes to him he is STILL credited with the steal IN MEMPHIS.  When he tips or deflects a ball, but never gains possession nor do the Grizzlies, he is still awarded a steal. \n\nThe following is just a very small % of questionable or outright WRONG steals and blocks given to Jackson: \n\nExample #1 New Orleans Pelicans @ Memphis Grizzlies \nSaturday 12/31\n7mins, 21 sec remaining in the 2nd quarter\nZion drives to the basket, NEVER shoots the ball, and loses it. \"Williamson in a crowd, ball pops free, picked up by Tyus Jones, turnover number 9 by the pelicans\" announcers say.  Scorekeeper in Memphis graded the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. blocks Zion Williamson's 3-foot driving layup \n\nExample #2 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies \nSunday 1/8 \n10:09 remaining in the 1st quarter\nJordan Clarkson throws a bad pass directly to Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson for some odd reason is credited with the steal.  Bane actually steals the ball. \n\nExample #3 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies\nSunday 1/8\n1:46 remaining in the 4th quarter\nKelly Olynyk loses the ball while being defended by Xavier Tillman.  The ball then bounces off Tillman and Jaren Jackson before being picked up by Tillman. The steal should be credited to Tillman.  Memphis scorekeeper grades the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. steals \n\nExample #4 Phoenix Suns @ Memphis Grizzlies\nMonday 1/16\n7:02 remaining in the 4th quarter\nBrandon Clarke blocks Saban Lee's layup, but the Memphis scorekeeper instantly gives the block to nearby Jaren Jackson Jr. \n\nExample #5 Cleveland Cavaliers @ Memphis Grizzlies\nWednesday 1/18\n11:48 remaining in the 2nd quarter\nLamar Stevens, who Jaren Jackson helps on, loses the ball and Desmond Bane picks it up and gains possession.  The Memphis scorekeeper gave steal to Jaren Jackson. \n\nExample #6 Detroit Pistons @ Memphis Grizzlies\nFriday, December 9th\n39 seconds remaining in the 2nd quarter\nJackson deflects a pass and never gains possession, saved back to Detroit player. Memphis scorekeeper gives a steal to Jackson. \n\nExample #7 Oklahoma City Thunder @ Memphis Grizzlies\nWednesday, December 7th\n10:38 4th quarter\nJackson saves out of bounds ball directly to Thunder player underneath basket for quick score, but gets credited with a steal. \n\nThank you very much for reading this.  I would appreciate well thought out responses, a good discussion, and also advice on how someone in charge at the NBA can investigate these plays as well as others from Grizzlies games, and the dishonest Memphis scorekeeper.  Also, can obviously fraudulent statistics be deleted, corrected & reversed weeks/months later?",

            "description": "[Source](https://kareem.substack.com/p/dear-lebron-heres-the-covid-19-help)\n\n> LeBron James is not only one of the greatest basketball players ever, he’s committed to being a leader in the African American community in the fight against inequality. But his Thursday Instagram meme showing three cartoon Spider-Men pointing at each other—one labeled “covid,” one labeled “flu,” one labeled “cold”—with his message: “Help me out folks” was a blow to his worthy legacy. The meme’s implication is that LeBron doesn’t understand the difference among these three illnesses, even after all the information that’s been presented in the press. Well, since he asked, let me help him out by explaining the difference—and how knowing that difference might save lives, especially in the Black community.\n> \n -----\n> \n> First, let’s put his meme in context. In September, LeBron stated: “I don’t talk about other people and what they should do. We’re talking about individual bodies. We’re not talking about something political or racism or police brutality. I don’t think I personally should get involved in what other people do for their bodies and livelihoods ... I know what I did for me and my family ... But as far as speaking for everybody and their individualities and things they want to do, that’s not my job.”\n> \n> Here’s the first problem with that statement: With 106 million Instagram followers, making such a post is automatically politically impactful because he questions the validity of the efforts to get the country vaccinated. As is evident by some of the comments that cheer LeBron’s post, he’s given support to those not getting vaccinated, which makes the situation for all of worse by postponing our health and economic recovery. The CDC reports that those who are unvaccinated are 9 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital and 14 times more likely to die from COVID than those vaccinated. The number rises to 20 time more likely when compared to someone who’s gotten a booster shot. By posting the uninformed meme, LeBron has encouraged vaccine hesitancy which puts lives and livelihoods at risk.\n> \n> Here’s the second problem with that statement: He says we’re not talking about racism, but we most definitely are. As of December 2020, about 97.9 out of every 100,000 African Americans had died from COVID-19, a third higher than that for Latinos (64.7 per 100,000), and more than double than that for whites (46.6 per 100,000) and Asians (40.4 per 100,000). According to an article on the U.S. National Library of Medicine site, “The overrepresentation of African Americans among confirmed COVID-19 cases and number of deaths underscores the fact that the coronavirus pandemic, far from being an equalizer, is amplifying or even worsening existing social inequalities tied to race, class, and access to the health care system.”\n> \n\n---- \n\n> A year later, the communities of People of Color are still suffering at a much higher rate than white communities. In November 2021, the CDC stated, “It has highlighted that health equity is still not a reality as COVID-19 has unequally affected many racial and ethnic minority groups, putting them more at risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19.” One study in Atlanta showed 79% of Blacks with COVID-19 were hospitalized versus 13% of whites. COVID-19 has resulted in a drop in life expectancy among whites of 1.2 years. Among the Black and Latinx communities it was more than 3 years.\n> \n> For those confident that the Omicron variant may not be as harsh as previous variants, it’s important to realize that, while most might come out of it okay, they can still unwittingly infect others along the way—the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, people with respiratory problems—who could end up hospitalized or dead. Also, almost half of those who recover from initial COVID-19 illness have “long-haul COVID,” with persistent symptoms of brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and headaches.\n> \n> For those pointing out that there are “breakthrough” cases in which the vaccinated contract COVID-19. Yes, but they also have lighter symptoms and are at a much less risk of dying than the unvaccinated. The crucial statistic here is this: 98-99% of Americans dying of COVID-19 are unvaccinated.\n> \n\n-----\n\n> Vaccine hesitancy is higher in the Black community than in any other. While there are certainly justifiable historical reasons for Blacks to be skeptical of the health care system that has routinely marginalized, ignored, and even illegally experimented on them, that is not enough to justify compromising their health and even losing their lives during the current health crisis.\n> \n> To directly address LeBron’s confusion, no one thinks colds and the flu aren’t serious. In the 2019-2020 flu season, 400,000 people were hospitalized and 22,000 people died. In 2020, 385,428 people died of COVID-19, while so far in 2021, 423,558 have died in the U.S., for a total of 808,986 deaths. Experts agree that COVID-19 is at least 10 times more lethal than the flu. As for the common cold, death is extremely rare.\n> \n> However, LeBron, if you’re concerned about the flu, then help promote the flu vaccination. In the 2019-2020 flu season, only 51.8% in the U.S. were vaccinated, well below the 70% that is the target. Worse, the vaccination rate is 20% lower among Blacks than whites and as a result they have the highest hospitalization rate due to flu of any other group. This is due to vaccination hesitancy that your meme promotes.\n> \n> One way to help the Black community to overcome their hesitancy and save lives is for prominent Black celebrities and influencers to continue to encourage everyone to get vaccinated and their boosters. Immunization, whether from vaccines or having had the disease, lessens over time and makes people vulnerable for reinfection.\n> \n> While LeBron is a necessary and dynamic voice critical of police brutality against the Black community, he needs to be the same necessary and dynamic advocate with vaccines, which could save thousands of Black lives right now. The racism is just as real—and just as lethal—in both cases.",

Only females have stingers as they are modified ovipositors. This means he must have been born a female, and later transitioned to a male before becoming the mascot for the Charlotte Hornets. I suspect this was kept quiet at the time because transgender individuals dealt with even more bigotry back in 1988 when he was introduced, than they do today. The other possibility is that he is a male hornet, and does not actually have a stinger. This makes sense if you look at their record.",

Over the course of this past year—an unusually tumultuous one in his otherwise starry career—*Naruto* was his north star.  \n>  \n>“From what I’ve been through to get to where I am and what I go through to this day,” he says, “*Naruto* has always been there and always will be.”  \n>  \n>**Zion estimates** that around 80% of players in the league are into anime; they just won’t admit it.  \n>  \n>“Sure enough, I’m 16 years old and suddenly all of the attention starts coming. I remember thinking, *Yo, that’s crazy. That’s exactly when it happened for Naruto, and it’s when it’s happening for me.*”\n\nShout out to the writer, Tres Dean, for this great piece of work!",

Man I sitting here trying to write something for this post but every time I try I begin crying again just thinking about you, niece Gigi and the friendship/bond/brotherhood we had!

I’m heartbroken and devastated my brother!! 😢😢😢😢💔. Man I love you big bro. My heart goes to Vanessa and the kids. I promise you I’ll continue your legacy man! You mean so much to us all here especially #LakerNation💜💛 and it’s my responsibility to put this shit on my back and keep it going!! Please give me the strength from the heavens above and watch over me! I got US here! There’s so much more I want to say but just can’t right now because I can’t get through it!

This is not an issue that many people in the NBA have been speaking about, for obvious reasons. No idea what will come of it, but it took a fair amount of bravery from Gobert to post this. \n\nI'm trying to refrain from making a joke about him \"defending\" the Uyghurs but it's fuckin hard guys",

For Portland Trail Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic, who says he lost several family members to the virus, the task ahead is vital.\n\n>His home country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, has been ravaged by COVID-19, with over 200,000 confirmed cases and 9,600 deaths reported to the World Health Organization, but it still has very limited access to the vaccine.\n\n>\"They just have donations, but not enough to vaccinate the people,\" Nurkic says. \"I tried to buy it for the whole country. I figured out the money, the plan and everything. But we still can't do it.\n\n>\"Even if we find vaccines, I guess United States laws say that until the American people are vaccinated, you can't sell it. So, I don't know what else to do. I really tried.\"\n\n>What's even harder, Nurkic says, is knowing how much vaccine supply is going unused in the United States, which he would gladly purchase for his country.\n\n>\"All these countries are suffering and you have the United States, obviously the No. 1 in the world, has the vaccines and people don't want to get vaccinated,\" he says.\n\n>\"I just feel like humanity has kind of failed, because all the countries around should get at least some of those vaccines, right?\"\n\n>Last July, just as the NBA's bubble was beginning in Florida, Nurkic learned that his grandmother in Bosnia and Herzegovina had contracted COVID-10 -- and treatment options were limited.\n\n>\"After 17 days, she survived the COVID,\" Nurkic says. \"Then on Day 19, she had a heart attack. It was unbelievable.\"\n\n>Nurkic got the news as he was on a bus to a game.\n\n>\"At that point, I wished I could just take a plane to go to the funeral,\" he says. \"Probably, if I could do it again, I would do that. It's difficult when you're really far away.\"\n\nGreat stuff from Nurk.",

Because Kyrie Irving’s thought process is an example of what happens when the education system fails.\n\n> Last October, I wrote a piece about Kyrie Irving’s refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19 (“Should We Just ‘Leave Kyrie Alone?”) and why this reckless choice was destructive to the country and especially the Black community where he would be an influential role model. The facts proved that accusation to be true. Irving didn’t care. He continued to promote his anti-vax sentiments—regardless of the cost in lives and health to others—proclaiming himself a “martyr.” Not kidding.\n\n> We might have just left him alone to stew in his own gelatinous ignorance. Rich and famous people get away with saying dumb things all the time because their money isolates them from consequences. They surround themselves with Yes-people whose job is to confirm whatever hare-brained ideas they have. Yes, sir, Mr. Irving, the Earth has never been flatter.\n\n> But now Irving is back and more destructive, insensitive, and just plain silly than before. He decided it would be a good idea to post a 2002 video clip from Infowars founder Alex Jones. Yeah, the guy who has been on trial for denying the Sandy Hook shootings and who previously admitted in open court that he’s a performer and his onscreen persona is just a character (that bilks millions of dollars from unaware viewers). The main gist of the clip is a warning about a cabal of international leaders who are secretly releasing plagues on the world from which they can profit. (Of course, we know who really profits from making this claim.)\n\n> Alex Jones is one of the most despicable human beings alive and to associate with him means you share his stench.\n\n> Kyrie Irving would be dismissed as a comical buffoon if it weren’t for his influence over young people who look up to athletes. When I look at some of the athletes who have used their status to actually improve society—Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, Muhammad Ali, Bill Russel, Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe, and more—it becomes clear how much Irving has tarnished the reputations of all athletes who strive to be seen as more than dumb jocks.\n\n> Irving does not seem to have the capacity to change, but we have the capacity to keep fighting against his brand of destructive behavior. One way to do that, beyond shaking our heads and nasty tweets, is to write to his sponsors and tell them to drop Irving—or you will drop them. Nike has likely decided not to renew his contract past this season. But he is still sponsored by Pepsi and 2K Sports. (Don’t feel bad for Irving: his career earnings at the end of the 2022-’23 season will be $230 million. That buys a lot of Yes-people.)\n\nhttps://kareem.substack.com/p/kareem-reacts-to-the-news-desantis-6ca",

            "description": "We have seen the way the country has rallied behind this movement. NBA players have been finding their voices, players like Dwight and Patty Mills have opted to donate salary, clearly there is no fear to speak out on important issues throughout a large portion of the league.\n\nBut now, when it comes to this, it is only silence. The way I see it, they either know it is wrong and choose to be silent, or they do not know that what he is doing is wrong, and both of these are incredibly disappointing. \n\nI’m a fan of all of these guys, I know Stephen Jackson is a good dude at heart from what everyone is saying, but this whole thing is making me rapidly lose respect for him and the players who are supporting him. I really can’t believe that after so many spoke out against Drew Brees, that not one player will openly condemn anti-Semitic comments and behaviours. \n\nIf we don’t all look out for one another, there’ll be nobody left to look out for us... we’re all a family... the division Stephen Jackson is causing is the very thing he is against. I cannot believe that nobody has so much as tweeted about this. It really, really sucks to see.",

            "description": " If you have ever had the chance to watch a basketball game on TNT, you might have caught yourself as glued to the half-time show as the actual game. *NBA on TNT* is one of the best sports broadcasts hosted by some of the boldest personalities on TV: Shaquille O’Neil, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and of course… Charles Barkley. \n\nThere are no subjects off limits and no quarter is given. But there is one topic that never fails to elicit strong consternation from Ernie despite roars of laughter from Shaq— Charles Barkley’s bit about the Big ol Women™ of San Antonio. If you haven’t seen it, here’s one of the best supercuts to catch you up: \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k) \n\nAs you can see, Chuck is fascinated with San Antonio — well, with the women and churros of San Antonio at least. He brings up the subject so often that simply googling “San Antonio Women” yields almost exclusively articles and clips of Barkley & Co. discussing the virtues of San Antonio churros, the Big ‘ol Women™ who eat them, and the city’s curious lack of Victoria’s Secret stores.\n\n \n\n[ google search results for generic query \\\\\"San Antonio Women\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/81yphxq1mwg41.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=37f18954312ed009a9e3c4d2d6620d7e15a06900)\n\nFrom his time as a [player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMzdAZ3TjCA), to his current career as a broadcaster, Barkley is infamous for never minding his tongue. When it comes to making Shaq and the production crew keel over with laughter, it’s clear he has no plans to change his humorous tone, no matter how much Ernie scorns him.  \n\n\n***But did you ever wonder why… Why is Chuck so fixated on the Big ol Women*****™** ***of San Antonio and their unique pastry/ lingerie inclinations?***\n\n  \n***Is there something more behind the man’s obsession?***\n\nSo began my search to understand the enigma that is Charles Wade Barkley…\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Research\n\nI started out by attempting to confirm or refute Barkley’s suspicions… \n\n* Does San Antonio have a lot of Big ol Women™? \n* Is Victoria really a “Secret” in San Antonio?, and\n* How do fried Spanish pastries play into this whole thing?\n\nWell let’s break it down one-by-one…\n\n \n\n**San Antonio’s Big ol Women™**\n\nI compared obesity rates for every NBA city to determine if there is any merit to Chuck’s claim that San Antonio has an abundance of plus-sized ladies…\n\n[ NBA cities ranked by Obesity Rates ](https://preview.redd.it/9mm0ytabmwg41.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=6761f072a5ca61b9a1c7d47d1ae4bc3b9c64aee6)\n\nAs it turns out, he is right on point. According to my analysis of a 2018 CDC report, San Antonio is the 4th chunkiest city in the NBA with more than 37% of adults registering as “clinically obese”. And with over half of San Antonians identifying as female, it’s safe to say the city *does* have a lot of *Big ol Women™*.\n\nInteresting side note: San Antonio isn’t just one of the fattest cities in the nation, they also have a distinct love for the rolls (pun intended). Per my research, San Antonio ranks #2 in the country for most google searches for “BBW”, which is of course the porn abbreviation for *Big Beautiful Women*. Not sure the significance of this fact, or how I came upon this information, but thought it was worth mentioning.\n\n[google trend statistics for search term \\\\\"bbw\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/44t42v5dmwg41.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9e965defdcc0bedd498dea3ee1369f16326141)\n\n *How many of these searches belong to Chuck himself? No small amount, I can assure you.*\n\n \n\n**“Who’s Victoria?” — San Antonio**\n\nUsing [Victoria’s Secret store locator](https://www.victoriassecret.com/store-locator), I compiled the total number of store locations in each NBA city. Then, using 2016 U.S. Census Bureau statistics, I appended the populations for each city and calculated the amount of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita.\n\n[ NBA cities ranked by Victoria's Secret stores per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/a8l2hdrgmwg41.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e81c43e0ac765ac3237f7df91ba0a1e2708772)\n\nAgain, Chuck’s intuition was spot-on! The city of San Antonio has the 4th fewest number of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita of all NBA cities (bottom 89th percentile).\n\nI guess it’s safe to conclude, Victoria really is a secret in San Antonio.\n\n*The author contacted Victoria’s Secret Public Relations prior to publishing this article but they chose not to comment on this story.*\n\n \n\n**How do fried Spanish pastries play into this?**\n\nTremendously, that’s how.\n\nI literally spent over three hours immersed in “churro data”. Admittedly, one of those hours was a lunchtime run to “Angel’s Churros & Chocolates” in Houston, TX — shout out to Maria for hooking it up with the Nutella on the side!\n\nUsing cutting-edge scientific research tools, I determined the number of churro vendors per capita in each NBA city. Okay, I googled that shit. I figured counting Mexican restaurants in general would be super misleading so I quantified specifically the number of churro vendors in each NBA city using the following criteria: Performed the google search “\\[CITY\\] Churros” (e.g., “San Antonio Churros”) and counted the amount of vendors with *explicit* references to “Churro” in the name. I accepted various spellings and puns (e.g., “xurros”, or “Churroholic”, etc).\n\n[ NBA cities ranked by churro-vendors per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/9gjixg6kmwg41.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4fe6433feafdaa01a5a827a841ca236988cc978)\n\nWell Mr. Barkley’s hunch was right again… San Antonio has the 4th most Churro-Vendors per capita in the NBA (top \\~90th percentile). Have to admit, though, I did *not* expect to see Salt Lake City rank so high on this list. Considering the [strip club rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), I might actually have to make a trip to the ‘great white west’… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have to give credit to Chuck here; he certainly knows his stuff! But for a man who [disavows data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZf9NFaCQHQ), it begs the question, how does he know so much about the Alamo city?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Analysis\n\nWith my suspicions on the rise, I dug deeper into the data. And the more I dug, the more it smelled… \\*sniff\\* and I love the smell of cinnamon and projection in the morning. So what is Mr. Barkley hiding? Well, I analyzed his career performance in San Antonio to see if there is more to the story.\n\nCharles Barkley has an [impressive resume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley): two-time Olympic gold medalist, 11-time NBA All Star, 1993 Most Valuable Player, and an esteemed member of the NBA hall of fame. He went by the intimidating moniker, *Round Mound of Rebound*. He is, indubitably, one of the greatest ballers of all time. But, just like all the greats, he had a weakness…\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**‘The Biggest Loser’**\n\nBetween the years 1983–1998, Barkley played 19 games in San Antonio. *He won just 4 of them*. With his career road-win percentage at nearly .500, and considering the other damning stats laid out below, his .211 win rate in San Antonio falls soundly in the \"*curious\"* column.\n\n* Career Road W/L Record: 259–276 (.484 win%)\n* San Antonio W/L Record: 4–15 (.211 win%)\n\n \n\n[ W\\/L split, Career Away vs in San Antonio ](https://preview.redd.it/hiw4wzawmwg41.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=49520e597148522c9414d67508b7de45bb8d8eac)\n\nNow I don’t want to mislead you, San Antonio were no schmucks during this period and, obviously, basketball is a team sport. But Barkley carries most of the water: he was a generational talent and the stand-out star on most of his teams (aside from a couple years with a washed up Julius Erving and an aging Moses Malone in Philly and a couple with near-retirement Hakeem in Houston). But the following analysis should help further make my case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**‘My -25% Life’**\n\nSan Antonio proved to be a blight on Barkley’s esteemed career. My analysis showed significant declines in almost every statistical category examined:\n\n* **GmSc** — Averaged a **-25% variance** in Game Score in SA compared to career avg\n* **ORB** — Averaged a -**11% variance** in Offensive Rebounds in SA as compared to career avg\n* **FT%** — Averaged a **-9% variance** in FT shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg\n* **FG%** — Averaged a **-2% variance** in shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg\n* **AST** — Averaged a **-6% variance** in Assists in SA as compared to career avg\n\nNote: [GmSc](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) (Game Score) is a John Hollinger-created stat that gives a comprehensive measure of a player’s productivity. Formula: *GmSc=PTS+(0.4\\*FG)–(0.7\\*FGA)–\\[0.4\\*(FTA-FT)\\]+(0.7\\*ORB)+(0.3\\*DRB)+STL+(0.7\\*AST)+(0.7\\*BLK)–(0.4\\*PF)-TOV*\n\nHere’s what the analysis looks like:\n\n[ Barkley performance analysis via heat mapping ](https://preview.redd.it/bm4bja82nwg41.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8908dd66fda7cb895c93a1f498644ed734988d1)\n\nYou can see the heat map to the left is covered in red. Red cells indicate *negative* variances, meaning: for that year, Barkley’s average in San Antonio was *below* his Season Average. Of the 112 total data points examined (8 stats x 14 seasons), Barkley under-performed against the season average **62%** of the time.\n\nHeat maps are great but I needed to visualize the data in a way that better depicts the scale of Chuck’s drop in performance. I used a clustered column chart because it gives the best visual representation of relative performance, as you can easily identify the +/- trends (*Graphs for Dummies: larger/more frequent lines on BOTTOM = BAD; larger/more frequent lines on TOP = GOOD*). \n\n \n\n[Barkley GmSc Variance in SA vs Season Avg](https://preview.redd.it/d7u0gmi4nwg41.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=2060d12d0604f038bcbb8c7a135b5a0b22ff9816)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Barkley Shooting Eff.

But what do they truly *tell us*?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#  Conclusion\n\nWell, if you’ve been following along, things should be starting to make sense. A picture has formed… how could a man who so ardently rebukes data science, know things about San Antonio that only the *data* can tell us?\n\nEvery Great had their weakness. MJ couldn’t stop gambling. Shaq couldn’t hit free throws. Magic couldn’t keep it in his pants. Kobe never saw a shot he didn’t like. LeBron, hairline.\n\nFor Charles Barkley, it was an entire city. The plus-sized women of San Antonio and their delectable Spanish pastries were the Round Mound’s kryptonite. And it appears he never got over it. A career of indulgence in the Alamo City has left him bitter with regret.\n\nThe Chuckster has used his platform on TNT to — not very credibly — disguise his own predilections for the amenities of San Antonio. Without stretching the facts too far, we can paint a vivid picture of Barkley’s own struggle. Imagine: a perpetual Big-and-Tall man since roughly the age of 12 (guessing) and a basketball phenom would have become accustomed to night-after-night by himself with nothing but his appetite and a sense that — thanks to his coaches — he *deserved* to be rewarded. That he was a *good boy*. Another city, another game, another 4-star hotel room to himself (another sold-out show, as it were).\n\nThe excitement of seeing San Antonio on the schedule brings tears to the man’s eyes. He knows what awaits him and purposefully forgets what happened before…\n\n>*Barkley, awaken by the morning sun’s blistering reflection off the San Antonio R̶i̶v̶e̶r̶* [*Creek*](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-River-Authority-fires-back-at-Charles-5465978.php)*, sees the debris and refuse from an all-night binge. He did it again. Churro wrappers crinkling beneath his weight, cinnamon sugar coating the corners of his mouth and fingers alike, and a familiar wave of anxiety that tends to come after relapse. As his memory from the prior night returns, he glances around the room with a vain hopefulness that he did not ‘fall’ alone. He was relieved to learn that, in fact, he was not alone in the previous night’s debasement. Positioned heavily — nay, crushingly — on the duvet is a Big ol Woman™ sporting a handsome pair of* [*bloomers*](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lolita-Women-Sweet-Bloomers-Underwear-Pumpkin-Shorts-Safety-Pants-Cosplay-/182538951060)*. Her voluminous mass reassuring him — no, beckoning him — to forgive himself for his indiscretions. It wasn’t just him after all. But he knew exactly what he had done. In a rush to forget, he licked the crusted cinnamon from his lips, quietly donned his game day attire and snuck out to meet his teammates in the lobby.*  \n>  \n>  \n*But his mind would never leave that hotel room.*\n\nIt is through painting this portrait of a man both conflicted and passionate (aren’t we all) that we can better understand the system of associations that have led Barkley to betray his own naked psychology for all the world to jeer at. And yet, can we blame the man? Are we not all, on some level, looking for someone to share in our appetites? Whether it be for the occasional night of plus-size women and churros, or too many designer handbags; everyone has a vice. Unfortunately, from years of shame for letting down his teammates and coaches, Chuck has betrayed the very thing that he loves. \n\nThat’s why I’m here to tell him, myself: **Stop Projecting, Mr. Barkley.**\n\n**In 2020, the decade of proclaimed** **ass-eating, there is** ***no*** **shame. It’s** ***okay*** **to stan for Big ol Women™. In fact, it’s** ***great.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheck out all my work [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lNoKqtpnvv9dAjpgalId-HeuiuwNwjxQjVqUqjlIj2s)\n\nThank you mods for letting me post this off-season content during the all star break!",

Even as a kid against 6-11 men his own size playing professionally (such as former Harlem Globetrotters!) he averaged 53.9ppg by age 17. I found game recaps of multiple 46 point performances for the Quakertown Fay's at age 17, and at least one 44 point game even at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders.\n\nThis is not only not often talked about, it's NEVER talked about. I've seen only a few references to his professional career that predated college basketball. When I researched this I found out it got him into potential trouble with the NCAA and so it was kept hushed and perhaps left to be forgotten.\n\n*EDIT* Allow me to plug one other researcher who I've come to learn first shared the photographs of Wilt playing for the Fay's a few years ago.

He \"only\" averaged 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games but with playoffs combined his 15 game average shoots up to 53.9ppg! This means 74ppg in the 6 playoff games as a Fay. I'm not sure if this is even possible so please take with a grain of salt. Though he did score 90 points in high school and 100 in the NBA including 5 other 70+ point games so who knows. This being against former pros his own size too including 6-11 former Globetrotter Andy Maddox!",

Last night on the broadcast they said he was a free agent and signed with the Suns, which is technically very true but doesn’t tell the full story:\n\nBiyombo stepped away from the game a couple of years ago to return to Africa and take care of his father, who got COVID. Biyombo flew him to Europe for treatment, but his father died. Biyombo was unable to find the will to return to the game and took a year off. \n\nHe came back this year because he wanted to play with a purpose, that purpose ultimately being donating his entire Suns salary to build a hospital back home in his dad’s name.\n\nIt’s a pretty touching story that should be known by all fans.",

Jackson offers no insight as a former point guard. Instead he spends most of the game poking fun at JVG and talking about absolute nonsense and quite frankly I’m sick of it. He distracts the fans and ruins the experience, especially when it’s a game when there’s so much on the line. ",

I want better for the next generation of Asian American athletes than to have to work so hard to just be \"deceptively athletic.\"  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2933593-jeremy-lin-asian-americans-tired-of-being-told-we-dont-experience-racism",

He will proudly support problems in other communities but doesn't get much support for his.  \n\nLin and Kareem are two players whos input I value beyond being famous.  Kareem called out the anti-Semitism when it was a topic and seems to really care.",

He’s starting to stack them up now, it’s not just the one from last night on Stewart.\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/MeaslyEnlightenedIrishsetter (multiple bron dirty plays, including tripping steph with his bad ankle injury history)\n\nhttps://streamable.com/r8e0xl (bron pushes Livingston midair to land on the same knee where he tore his ACL, MCL, PCL, lateral meniscus, and dislocated his knee cap)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Qd7Rn5U4VzY (bron pushes Embiid midair to land on his back)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SV0PsMLonPc (bron slide tackles steph)(after reading comments this one admittedly isn’t dirty, but I do think it was a reckless play with how big he is)\n\nAnother thing, how many nutshots did Draymond have to be “the ball kicker”? Was it more than 3? Not sure, anyways here’s Bron doing a few of em.\n\nhttps://streamable.com/re8j0 (bron knees steph in the balls)\n\nhttps://streamable.com/lh45i (bron elbows Iggys balls)\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/serenepowerlessilladopsis (bron kicks Iggys balls)\n\nA lot of these are on guys who had a bad history with injuries. Lebron really needs to stop these antics or he’s going to seriously injure someone eventually.\n\nEdit: https://youtu.be/9adZfNyHylI (yet another one from midair)\n\nhttps://v.redd.it/np93tyhjtg271 (bron pushes Payne midair)\n\nhttps://streamable.com/mg3brt (bron pushes Ayton midair, this is starting to look like a trend)\n\nhttps://streamable.com/lef9sa (bron body checks Ayton HARD, can hear it across the stadium)\n\nEdit 2: lol the Lehive been released, watch out everybody\n\nEdit 3: For all the people going thru my post history lookin for hypocrisy or some shit, you ain’t gonna find it just more Bron hate sry",

They complain about the big teams/stars being out and say fans aren't going to watch because the relative unknowns are the only ones left\n\nThis only happens because NBA media sucks at covering their own sport. Speaking specifically about the Suns, the storylines are practically spoon-fed to them and all year all they've done is down-play and ignore rather than hype up.\n\nThey could've talked about the team going from 20 wins to 2nd best team in just 2 years. About Booker going from the bottom to the top, proving the doubters wrong, and trying to become legendary for Kobe. They could've focused Cam Payne going from out of the league to 6th man for a .700 team or hyped up how the bubble changed our culture.\n\nThey could've spoken about how James Jones came out of nowhere to become an excellent GM or how Monty is proving his old doubters wrong. They could've talked about Ayton's humility and huge improvement throughout the year or Bridges being a winning role player everywhere on the court\n\nInstead of all that, they just talked about CP3 because that's all they knew. And rather than doubting a team for their improbable run, they could've hyped it up more. \n\nThey just wanted to focus on big names and popular teams and were unprepared that others might have success so now a ton are either scrambling or complaining about the matchups and how \"they're bad for the NBA.\"\n\nWhy does the NBA media do this? No other league does it. When KC and Mahomes came out of nowhere it was all about hyping them up, not downplaying or ignoring them\n\nSuch a large portion of NBA media just sucks at their job",

            "description": "After watching ESPN’s coverage of the Western Conference Finals, I seriously don’t understand how Mark Jackson is the best that ESPN can do as far as in-game analysts go.\n\nJackson’s commentary is, at best, perfunctory.  He offers the same type of analysis as the [baseball scouts in Moneyball](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DtumWOsgFXc&pp=ygUQTW9uZXliYWxsIHNjb3V0cw%3D%3D), just regurgitating platitudes about how so-and-so is a “winning player” or the “type of guy you want on your team.”  When he does go out on a limb and offer a real opinion, I find that the opinion he offers is usually stupid.  For example, in last night’s game, with Denver up two late, the Lakers had a side-out with 3.2 on the shot clock.  Jackson’s analysis?  “If you’re Denver, you want to make sure LeBron doesn’t get a step-back three.”  Motherfucker, that’s the exact shot Denver had been forcing LeBron to beat them with all series, and he was shooting it poorly all series.  Naturally, Denver, a team led by a man who has been able to retain his employment as an NBA coach, walled up inside and prevented them from getting an easy two to tie it up.  \n\nJackson also is one of those commentators who clearly comes in with an agenda of what he expects (some would say “wants”) to happen.  He clearly hadn’t prepared for the possibility of Denver dominating the series, and when they won last night he basically fell silent for the entire post-game show.  \n\nLook at the comments in almost any ESPN-covered game on here, and you’ll find countless examples of fans complaining about the commentary and begging for more games to be on TNT to get a respite from Jackson. It seems like fans are pretty universally on board with wanting a change.  Jackson isn’t even a very big name like Reggie Miller or Grant Hill (both of whom are far better analysts than he is), so I don’t understand the appeal - I can’t imagine any casual fans are particularly curious what Mark Jackson’s thought are on a given game. \n\nThat’s not even mentioning that he’s apparently [so bad at the non-commentary aspects of his job](http://amp.awfulannouncing.com/nba/after-mvp-voting-fiasco-is-mark-jackson-still-a-viable-head-coaching-candidate-in-the-nba.html) that he accidentally voted for what he thought was All-NBA twice instead of submitting his desired MVP ballot. \n\nAND, on top of all that, there’s Mark Jackson’s alleged [history of homophobia](https://www.knbr.com/2022/05/10/mark-jackson-reportedly-used-homophobic-slurs-said-rick-welts-and-jason-collins-were-going-to-hell-as-warriors-head-coach/).  Now, I know that corporate “allyship” is all fake and performative.  I also am not one of those people who thinks that mere allegations of bad behavior or beliefs should immediately get you fired from your job.  But when I’m watching the games and I know that the commentator is a probable homophobe ON TOP OF being terrible at his job, it makes it extra frustrating that they just keep bringing him back.\n\nSo, why does ESPN insist on keeping him on? He’s not that big of a name, has a dubious personal history, and - most importantly - he doesn’t produce a good end product.  \n\nWhat is he offering that another commentator can’t?",

The day I decided it wasn’t all about me and it’s about us is the day I started winning and really started dominating. I understand the issues and all that. But I took the vaccine because I’m not trying to get my mother sick, or my sister or my brother or people around me. I know people say, ‘The vaccine came too fast and is it healthy.’ To each his own. But sometimes you have to think about the overall picture and you have to think about more than yourself.\n> \n> \"I wouldn’t want to be part of a team that couldn’t get together and couldn’t win a championship because you did this. So sometimes you have to look in the mirror and say, ‘It ain’t about me; it’s about other people.’ As men, you have to respect a guys’ decision. But if I was on the team and I was a guy that had a say on the team, I would say, ‘You have to get him out of here; he’s a distraction.’ They have a really good shot to win. With him there, they have an even better shot. But I don’t want to come to practice every day having to answer questions about him. I’ve been through that before, and it’s nerve-wracking. We want to come to play and win and focus on what we have to do. We don’t want to focus on him not doing this or not doing that. Or the NBA can say, ‘If you don’t want to follow the laws and the guidelines, we’ll forfeit all of your money.’ I think a lot of times when you have the guaranteed contract, guys think they can do whatever they want to do. I’m not bashing him. It’s his decision. But they’re trying to win there and need to get this done. If everyone else on the team could do it, he should think about that.\"\n\n-----\n\nI love this take from Shaq.",

AMAs as a platform are best when the users and the subject come together and collaborate with interesting questions and answers.\n\nToday, when AD started answering questions, the top of the thread was filled with jokes, trolling, and dozens of questions about that one leaked video from Kentucky. That is in no way conducive to a good AMA - he was set up to fail from the start. \n\nHowever, before today we saw it as not our place to make the AMA thread a graveyard of [removed] - that’s just as bad. With that said, it seems that going forward we may need to be more heavy handed in the removal of questions - particularly duplicates and questions that are clearly inappropriate and won’t be answered.\n\nAlso please keep in mind, that we are often limited in the times that we can announce, and in how much we are able to prepare beforehand, or what we can do with many of these events.

            "description": "Strap in boys, it's gonna be a ride. So I've basically reviewed the whole game last night, and here are the questionable plays which I thought should have been calls/were called wrongly.\n\n#Calls going against Rockets:\n\n1. [Wrong travelling call against Capela](https://streamable.com/cso98), didn't lift up his pivot foot.\n\n2. [Slight push on PJ Tucker no call, KD gets the call on the other end](https://streamable.com/boqtv). Probably a superstar call.\n\n3. [Harden might have gotten shoved in the back by Looney](https://streamable.com/7189z), no call.\n\n4. [Capela called for a goaltend for what seemed to be a clean block](https://streamable.com/qtz8u).\n\n5. [Harden fouled on the landing](https://streamable.com/4d9r6), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/s06jh)\n\n6. [Harden fouled on three attempt](https://streamable.com/bzjys), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/alpcm)\n\n7. [Ref disallows continuation on Harden's three](https://streamable.com/vhads). [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/lydp2)\n\n8. [Eric Gordon fouled by Draymond](https://streamable.com/zynw6), no call.\n\n#Calls going against Warriors:\n\n1. [Klay gets called for an early 2nd foul which didn't look like much contact](https://streamable.com/e0s94), looked like ball just slipped out of EG's hands.\n\n2. [Curry's hip gets pushed by Gerald Green](https://streamable.com/o4nk6), even falls on the ground. No call.\n\n3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)\n\n4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)\n\n5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.\n\n6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).\n\nA major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:\n\nhttps://streamable.com/el34r\n\nhttps://streamable.com/vtmzu\n\nhttps://streamable.com/uv829\n\nhttps://streamable.com/9fqlg\n\nhttps://streamable.com/junss\n\nhttps://streamable.com/2peej\n\nhttps://streamable.com/53mhy\n\nhttps://streamable.com/cuojo\n\nhttps://streamable.com/07r5o\n\nBonus Harden trying to draw foul when there was none & just looking like a fool:\n\nhttps://streamable.com/ca5v5\n\nhttps://streamable.com/jffyc\n\nOh and, inb4 Rockets fans accuse me of bias again, and calling me a Warriors fan. Would a Warrior fan post these?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8lyh34/ariza_gets_called_for_a_blocking_foul_on_durant/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ly16n/curry_draws_3_free_throws_from_capela/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8lfvoo/draymond_going_back_to_his_bad_habits/\n\nThe entire game is freely available online, if you're so angry why don't you make your own compilation? And u/unklebuckets, still waiting for [your refs lowlights thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mf8tv/post_game_thread_the_golden_state_warriors_33/dzn4mpy/?context=3), or any of the 1+ million subscribers to make one.\n\nEdit: [Summary of the night](https://i.imgur.com/fHlyNne.jpg) lol.

Every post that leans towards one direction or the other becomes a venue for every hater to vent all of their frustrations at once. It's happened to both the Rockets and the Warriors in the past 24 hours, and it makes this sub unbearable to come to sometimes. \n \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe officiating was poor both ways. For every moving screen Capela set, Draymond held onto Rocket defenders during switches. For every missed foul Gordon got driving to the rim, the same happened to Curry. It's just the way the game goes, and it didn't look inherently biased either way. We don't need a post every ten minutes bringing this argument back up.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt'd be great to just have this sub return to a venue to look at highlights and actual basketball analysis instead of reactionary BS.",

Really good stuff. \n\nOne of the most amazing things to me in r/nba is that the second there is a missed call going one way, it's called as indisputable proof that the game is rigged. Refs miss calls. They do in every sport. \n\n* MLB Umpires miss balls and strikes and tags. \n* NFL refs miss holding, pass interference, defining whats a catch. \n* NHL refs miss offsides, too many men, hooking, slashing, goalie interference. \n\nIt happens. It is part of the game.\n\nLast night was a prime example of what is commonly known as \"Playoff Basketball\". The game becomes a lot more physical. If you don't believe me, go take a look back and watch the way the game was played in the 80s, 90s and 2000s. \n\nThe Warriors had to learn how to fight through this style of play. It's a big reason that teams like the Grizzlies and that 14-15 Cavs team gave them fits. They knew what they could get away with and they used it to their advantage. This Warriors team has fought through this kind of basketball for 4 straight years. Even during the regular season, the Warriors often have to fight through this kind of play, with teams giving them their best shot.\n\nThe Rockets are a team that works for foul calls. When they get them, defenders are forced to play a bit off their man and the offense opens up.  When the game is allowed to be a bit more physical (as it tends to in the playoffs) it can be very detrimental to their game-plan. \"When you're used to being privileged, equality feels like oppression\".\n\nBut to their credit, they adjusted in this series and began playing a lot more physical on the defensive side of the ball. They were getting up in players faces, hitting arms, holding, whatever they could get away with. Early in this game, it was working for them. They were by far the more physical team. I think what ultimately caught up to them was their short rotation and the fact that they were playing at 110% throughout the first 24 minutes. ",

Here is each step below:\n\n1.  Let Blake Griffin leave (they re-signed him to a 5 year max deal).\n\n2.  Trade DeAndre (they kept him until his contract expired)\n\n3.  Trade Lou Williams (they kept and even re-signed him)\n\n4.  Trade Patrick Beverly (they kept and even re-signed him)\n\n5.  Fire Doc (kept him)\n\n6.  Don't trade Austin Rivers (they traded him)\n\n7.  Don't move to Inglewood (they are moving to Inglewood)\n\n8.  Don't hire a GM (they hired one)\n\n9.  Go after LeBron (I don't think they really even tried)\n\n10.  Don't try and take over LA from the Lakers (they are trying)\n\n11.  Move to Seattle (they obviously aren't)",

Living in Arizona, those people were awesome. But Milwaukee was the better team. When I picked Milwaukee to win the series, it was painful for me. I wanted to pick the Suns. But I just didn’t see how the Suns can beat those guys. If you’re not happy for Giannis Antetokounmpo, there’s something wrong with you. He represents everything that is great about basketball.\"\n\n>Q: Giannis has already been a two-time MVP. But how did you see Giannis take his game even to another level more during the Bucks’ championship run?\n\n>Barkley: “I don’t think he took his game to another level. I think the other guys stepped up. I thought the addition of Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker and Bobby Portis were huge. Those guys are mentally tough. Giannis did Giannis things, and he obviously was special in that close-out game. But the guy won back-to-back MVP’s for a reason.

You would hope the NBA applies both parts of it when they meet in the summer this year.  The penalty for an unsportsmanlike foul is 2 free throws and the ball.

            "description": "Giannis is the son of Nigerian immigrants that came to Greece in search of a better life. In reality, their life would be exceedingly difficult; they were homeless, they struggled to find work, and they were constantly in fear of deportation as they were unable to acquire full Greek citizenship. They had four children to feed, and often there was not enough to go around. In the worst of times, Giannis and his family would go two or three days without eating.\n\nAt 13, Giannis, rail-thin and with no basketball experience, was discovered by a (previously) failed basketball scout. After the scout promised to secure Giannis’ parents with employment, Giannis began playing for a local club and improving his skills. \n\nEven in this time, Giannis’ family did not have resources, and it was people like cafe owner Giannis Tzikas, who used to give the family sandwiches for free, that kept them afloat. In the words of Tzikas, some people asked, “why are you feeding the black kids”, but this only made him more determined to help. \n\nBy 2012, Giannis had somehow managed to become an exciting prospect in Greece’s basketball second division, which initially was too obscure of a location to be noticed by many NBA scouts. However, he was noticed by Basket Zaragoza in Spain, who offered him 400,000 euros a year to play for them. Giannis was indescribably excited, saying “I’ll bring my family along with me and I’ll buy a car”.\n\nShortly afterwards, Giannis began to be hyped up by NBA scouts; he was the 2013 draft’s most exciting unknown. With the 15th pick, the Bucks took a chance on him, and the rest is history. \n\nIn Giannis’ rookie season, then teammate Brandon Knight described Giannis regularly carrying six or seven boxes of free food home from the players lounge. When Caron Butler casually threw away a pair of shoes, Giannis, who had grown up sharing one pair with now teammate Thanasis, pulled them out of the garbage, shocked that someone would just throw away such good shoes. \n\nEven now, after signing the biggest contract in league history, Giannis has not forgotten his roots. He regularly gives his money and his time to help people in Milwaukee and in Greece, and has never forgotten to give back in spreading kindness and joy. \n\nWinning a championship in a market that doesn’t attract superstars is a difficult feat, but Giannis’ story shows that he has already done the hard part. Back in 2014, the fresh-faced, 195 pound, 19-year-old Giannis was asked, “So you got a job, a place to live, what’s next”? Giannis responded, somewhat jokingly, “Nothing. Just win a ring now”. After accomplishing everything else, this year might just be his chance.",

[...] And Lin wasn't some under-the-radar prospect from a unknown town in a backwoods state. He played at ARCO Arena for the California high school championship; he played for a well-known program and well-known coach Peter Diepenbrock (now the head coach at Canada College in Redwood City). He was seen by many coaches and all of them passed (myself included) on a scholarship offer -- thinking that Lin's success couldn't possibly be replicated against Division I competition.\n",

He yelled about having seven decisions in a row. He refused to compliment Belal; instead stating “I don’t know what happened with Leon”. He made it clear hes uninterested in resigning Mokaev. \n\nI thought it was a pretty solid card. There was a big streak of decisions before paddy’s submission but Wood, Hadley, Mokaev, and Allen all put on solid performances imo. Dana made it sound like utter shit and downed everyone.  \n\nSounds like he’d prefer running BKFC after hearing him in the presser, but maybe winning my parlays made me biased. \n\n",

Again, love the card, but I would be on the lookout for autographed cards and possible graded cards off of eBay (much cheaper then you think to just buy a 10).

We could even do a throwback to the old ufc undisputed series and allow us to have a strike force mode where we would get to play as all the old strike force fighters like Jason Miller, Nick Diaz, Robbie lawler, etc. The Strikeforce mode would also only use the old Strikeforce rules. EA could also use another take from from the undisputed series and give us back the old pride mode. Would also like to get a full updated roster including Dominik Reyes, Petr Yan, Volkanovski, and also upadate the weight classes the fighters have been in so we can recreate some those iconic fights like Poriere and Holloway in the LW division.",

Chan Sung Jung or Colby is going to go for a lot less than Gaethje. Conor, Suga or Caio Borralho (RC) is going to be a lot more expensive.\n\nThat being said, it's on card with nickname and signature, this should sell for more than a panini sticker auto 1/1\n\nI would check 130point every once in a while to look for other AKA 1/1 sales. You'll get a rough comp & can adjust your price according to popularity",

Portland win a free kick outside the box.\n\n9' - Chance for New York! Morales takes the ball down the right wing and finds Castellanos, it's out for a corner.\n\n12' - Some shouts for a pen as Tayvon Gray goes down on the edge of the box but it'll be a goal kick.\n\n14' - The referee blows for a foul on George Fochive in the middle of the field; NYC want a caution but Villarreal lets him off with a final warning.\n\n16' - Yimmi Chará finds his way into the right side of the box and tees up Blanco, but the shot is deflected.\n\n18' - Asprilla and Gray come together near the sideline, play resumes with a throw-in.\n\n20' - James Sands brings down Felipe Mora with a tactical foul to halt a counter.\n\n24' - Castellanos goes to ground holding his face after a collision with Larrys Mabiala, though the contact was only to the shoulder.\n\n26' - Blanco lofts a ball to the back post for Mora, who was unable to finish.\n\n29' - Blanco finds himself on the ball on the left wing again but the cross is easily controlled by Johnson.\n\n31' - Morales finds Jesús Medina in the box, who flicks it right back; Morales tries to find the far post but it's just wide.\n\n34' - Portland on the attack for a few minutes; Maxi Morales looks to be hurt with a potential calf injury, not sure whether he'll continue much longer.\n\n37' - The cross from Santiago Rodríguez hits the side net.\n\n41' - [](/goal) **GOAL NEW YORK CITY!! The free kick from Maxi Morales finds the head of Valentin Castellanos at the back post, and NYC lead! The celebrations are cut short, though, as Jesús Medina is hit in the face by an object thrown from the crowd.**\n\n45+1' - Blanco has a great attempt from just outside the box, but his shot flies just wide-left of the frame.\n\n---\n\n[](/whistle) **Half time:** New York City FC lead the Portland Timbers, 1–0.\n\n[Confirmation has been given by Portland Timbers that the fan that threw the object at Medina has been escorted out of the stadium.](https://twitter.com/TimbersFC/status/1469783150838517760)\n\n---\n\n46' - The second half is underway!\n\n50' - NYC win a free kick just outside the box, and it's very nearly a second for New York! It's not entirely clear whether Clark got a hand on it or not but it's a corner for the visitors.\n\n53' - A Portland corner bounces around in the box and the Timbers desperately want a handball called on Maxime Chanot. Nothing from the ref though.\n\n57' - Rodríguez has a shot from outside the box but it's a relatively comfortable stop from Clark.\n\n58' - Clark with another good stop, this one denying Medina at the near post. He distributes out to the wing and the Portland attack wins a corner.\n\n59' - [](/yellow) Van Rankin takes down Rodríguez going down the sideline; it's the game's first caution.\n\n62' - [](/sub) Portland make the game's first changes, as Sebastián Blanco and George Fochive make way for Santiago Moreno and Cristhian Paredes.\n\n67' - A Portland cross falls at the feet of Josecarlos van Rankin just outside the six-yard box; his touch finds Asprilla, but he was offside.\n\n75' - Yimmi Chará has a chance but the ball ends up in the hands of Johnson.\n\n76' - Van Rankin's shot curls to the top post but Johnson makes a stop.\n\n80' - [](/sub) Santiago Rodríguez is replaced with Ismael Tajouri-Shradi for New York. [](/yellow) He takes his time coming off the field and is booked for time wasting.\n\n82' - Portland with a chance off of a free kick; Felipe Mora couldn't turn it in though.\n\n84' - [](/sub) Portland makes their third change, Jarosław Niezgoda replaces Dairon Asprilla.\n\n89' - [](/sub) A little late for some but Portland bring on Diego Valeri to replace Josecarlos van Rankin.\n\n90' - [](/yellow) Diego Chará is booked for a foul.\n\n90' - Four more minutes to conclude the season.\n\n90+1' - [](/yellow) Another yellow, this one for Jesús Medina.\n\n90+2' - [](/sub) Gudmundur Thórarinsson makes way for Malte Amundsen.\n\n90+4' - [](/goal) **GOAL PORTLAND!! It's a miracle for the Timbers! Portland's hopes for the title are still alive! With five seconds remaining on the clock, Felipe Mora has turned the ball in off a corner on a second-chance shot! We're tied and headed to extra time at Providence Park!**\n\n90+6' - Maxime Chanot, among other NYCFC players, show themselves to be very angry at a no-call in the box and are in the face of the assistant referee; they're in danger of a booking if they continue.\n\n---\n\n[](/whistle) **Full time:** A late equalizer draws the game at 1–1, and we're headed to extra time in the MLS Cup.\n\n---\n\n91' - We have begun extra time in Portland.\n\n95' - [](/sub) New York make a change, replacing Jesús Medina with Talles Magno.\n\n113' - Each team has a great chance; Paredes look as if he might score but Johnson came up with an amazing save!\n\n115' - Corner for NYCFC, taken by Morales; it bounces out to Gray but his shot is over the bar.\n\n117' - Santiago Moreno has a try from distance, easily saved.\n\n119' - Tajouri-Shradi on the ball while two players collide in the box; he loses possession and concedes a foul.\n\n---\n\n[](/whistle) **Full time of extra time:** Extra time concludes without a goal, and we'll decide a champion in penalties.\n\n---\n\n**Round One:** [](/goal) Valentin Castellanos (NYC) scores, bottom left.\n\n[](/own-goal) Felipe Mora (POR) is saved, bottom left.

The decision to withdraw MLS clubs from the historic US Open Cup in favor of the Leagues Cup (let’s be honest) has not only disrespected our soccer legacy but has also compromised the essence of the game we cherish.\n\nThe Leagues Cup might offer a shiny spectacle, in the mind of Garber, but it comes at the cost of sacrificing the rich tapestry of history and dreams woven into the fabric of the US Open Cup. It's a trade-off that cannot be justified when it means sidelining the grassroots, the dreams of aspiring talents, and the spirit of fair competition.\n\nWe call upon all passionate supporters of American soccer to take a stand! Pledge to opt out of watching and purchasing tickets for the Leagues Cup until MLS re-enters the US Open Cup. Let's send a powerful message that we refuse to compromise the integrity of our soccer heritage for commercial interests of a money grab tournament. \n\n**Why are we doing this?**\n\n- The US Open Cup embodies the essence of American soccer—a platform for dreams, fair competition, and inclusivity.\n  \n- The decision to prioritize the Leagues Cup over the US Open Cup erodes the roots of our sport, disconnecting the elite from the grassroots and stifling opportunities for aspiring talents.\n\n- MLS withdrawing from the US Open Cup damages the essence of soccer in the United States, dismissing its century-old legacy for short-term gains.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\nJoin us in taking a stand! Commit to cancelling your MLS Season Pass Subscription within the next few days so that they can notice the drop in subscriptions. Then consider boycotting the Leagues Cup until MLS reaffirms its commitment to the US Open Cup. If/when it comes time for you to opt in to your Leagues Cup tickets this year from your club, let them know why you will not be purchasing. Spread the word, let your passion for American soccer fuel this movement, and show that the soul of our sport is not for sale!\n\nSemi-worthless Change.org petition [HERE](https://chng.it/5chWsyMMzR)\n\nr/MLS it’s up to us to ensure that the love, passion, and history of American soccer are honored and cherished. Let's reclaim the legacy of the US Open Cup and keep the spirit of our beloved sport alive and thriving for generations to come.",

MLS has had to overcome all of the cultural perceptions about soccer and really teach the sport to an often hostile crowd. Football, which basically everyone is familiar with, can't even have a spring league despite being the overwhelmingly most popular sport in America. \n\nThe fact that we have the teams that we do, the upward trajectory that we enjoy, as well as the security to plan for another 20+ years is something we should all be thankful for. Kids have been born and can legally drink and MLS has always existed in their lifetime. That is amazing. \n\nEdit: a lot of people are commenting on the unique factors that lead to MLS' survival and AAF's demise without realizing that is what we have to be thankful for.",

From delaying its launch a full year, from 1995 to 1996, which everyone thought was suicide at the time, to nearly folding the entire league in 2001, to cutting out an entire state just to keep surviving.\n\nIn 2004, when RSL was added to the league, things finally started to look up. Hell, Chivas USA was widely considered a smart addition, and really still were, up until maybe 2012.\n\nThe next big stumble was the issue with the San Jose Earthquakes. 2005 should have been fantastic, with a high-flying national team and a 12 team league again. Instead, the Quakes get relocated because of stadium issues which, compared to now, weren't really issues so much as a lack of willingness to spend money and the thought that Houston would be an easier market to attract a new owner.\n\n2007 was the next big landmark point, with Toronto FC joining, David Beckham signing in LA, and eight teams playing in soccer-specific stadia. This is when \"modern MLS\" really began.\n\nSince then, MLS has never really looked perilous. Chivas USA was a big mess, the last CBA negotiations got ugly, and the USMNT not making the world cup still stings, but we've not just survived but grown and prospered. We're so lucky.",

Countless times going to games knowing we would lose but still showing up. Singing and chanting.\n\n  \nWe have what..? 6 or 8 podcast that talk about this team. The fanbase is here. The fanbase fell apart after what.. 3 or 4 years of having nothing to show for? Some people even left to go to Miami. Granted if you live in SoFlo its understandable. But this fanbase was in a lot of pain. Coaches being rotated out. Players not working with the system of the new coaches.  \n\n\nBut we finally got it right. Our FO finally got it right. The players even after draws are reportedly talking about the next game and how to improve. Their is so much hunger to win these games.   \n\n\nWe're very wounded at the moment. Many injuries.

[It did not look TOO shabby back then.](https://web.archive.org/web/20100327000136/reddit.com/r/mls)\n\nRoughly ten years and 24 teams later, we reach this incredible milestone! Over that span of time: we celebrated wins, spread the salt, Double Post, thrown shit to the fan, called out some bad guys, Chivas USA, reacted to highlights, shared with other fanbases, Wondo, vented like crazy, discussed who actually invented soccer, Saved the Crew, and many more things that I cannot fit here!\n\nWe reached this milestone because of the power of soccer. The game is simple to understand but garners tons of emotions and symbolizes passion and dedication that cannot be replicated by football, basketball, baseball, and other major league sports above soccer in the current local landscape.\n\nSoccer has not reached its full potential in our countries just yet, but the journey towards getting there is what will define  the future of the sport within our borders.\n\nDespite having our differences and bias based on our teams, we must remember that we still have a mission to cultivate, grow, and promote soccer. We have to set the example above all other sports and support each other by any means. We must remember our failures, learn from them going forward, and help each other as much as we can.\n\nIt has been a great experience for thousands of us for almost ten years, and the mods and I are more than happy to volunteer our time moderating an outstanding community that is considered a family. Even though I was not here from the start, those that were here will tell you how much soccer has grown since then.\n\nHere is to soccer and thank YOU!\n",

Has not seen the field very much at all this year due to the performance of those above him and their lack of injuries. He has a girlfriend that he has been seing for over a year, basically since he came to Atlanta\n\n[Ezequiel Barco](https://www.instagram.com/barco.ezequiel/?hl=en) - Star Atlanta United player who has been a consistent fixture in the side since he became healthy after his huge transfer. He married shortly after arriving to Atlanta\n\n[Allysa Monique](https://www.instagram.com/allyssamonique/?hl=en) - (Vazquez girlfireind)\n\n\n[Mica Romeero](https://www.instagram.com/mica.romeero/?hl=en) - (Barco's newly married wife)\n\n\nThe word is that Barco has gotten with Vazquez's girlfriend. This is why Barco was suspended. \n\nInterestingly, Vazquez was subbed in to the first game Barco was suspended from after not seeing much action this season. Is Tata on Brandon's side? According to Spanish language social media there may be a falling out with Tata/Barco and a potential move to Flamengo? Not confident on this as it is second hand and I do not speak Spanish or Portuguese. But I'm including it because it's juicy as fuck\n\n\nVazquez has unfollowed Barco and his girlfriend on Instagram. He follows everyone else on the team.\n\nAllysa's insta went private as the story broke. literally refreshed as it went private\n\n\nBarco's (ex?)wife has posted a [photo without her wedding ring](https://www.instagram.com/p/BllQi_ynDSw/?hl=en&taken-by=mica.romeero) on insta. The text when translated says \"You're not what you do...You're what you get over\". Check her other photos, the ring is displayed prominently\n\nThis seems to have been am open seret among MLS journos. [This deleted tweet](https://twitter.com/gordonebombay/status/1021886499720245250?s=21) confirms it was Brandon’s gf and [this tweet says he actually slept with her](https://twitter.com/mlsist/status/1021873543930433548?s=21). This is the word among MLS journos\n\nThe short term implications of this seem to be future USMNT player Andrew Carleton moving into the starting lineup and Vazquez coming off the bench late in game\n\n\nWill update as info becomes available. Right now it is #TeamVazquez for life tho",

Good riddance]** It wasn't worth my time, and it won't be worth yours.\n\nSo let me be clear on a few things: \n\n1. This individual does not represent the Timbers fanbase as a whole, although a few of the upper-echelon of the TA are similarly elitist/pretentious. [Proof that we're not all bad.](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2018/12/readers-respond-kudos-from-atlanta-to-timbers-fans.html)\n\n2. **This 'ignorance' is  one of the main reasons for why I started this sub**\n\nMLS supporters league-wide deserve the same credit and respect (except those who blatantly violate laws/rules) regardless of pre-conceived notions. In my opinion, the several-hundred Chivas USA fans who brought it week-in-and-week-out regardless of adverse circumstances deserve the same credit as the 73,000 who packed Mercedes-Benz Stadium last Saturday.\n\nThe point of this sub is to put down allegiances and celebrate supporters, regardless of whether there's 10 or 1,500 of them. This elitist drivel about being a 'lesser supporter' is garbage. **The beauty of away travel is being able to experience other environments, not looking down on them as something that's not up to your standards.** \n\nFor this reason, I have strongly discouraged downvotes on this site. Many of you know I'm not exactly a fan of certain teams, but this sub is meant to acknowledge and share pictures of every team.\n\n**When it comes to supporter's culture, particularly away travel, we're all in this together** - especially in light of recent 'attacks' on away supporters from the powers that be.\n\nSo travel to away matches and enjoy the different environments. There are amazing stadiums, fanbases, and atmospheres throughout the nation, and there will be even more soon. And most importantly of all, don't be Don Cox or any other pompous supporter who thinks that what they have is special - I guarantee you it isn't.\n\n/rant over",

They apparently [missed the memo](https://www.weareecs.com/multimedia/category-news/258-soccer-for-all-ticket-prices) from 2014 when San Jose Earthquakes thought that Sounders fans would be excited about being the first event in an NFL stadium and wanted to charge $45 plus $8 in fees, with zero ability to buy as a group.\n\nECS boycotted that game as a blatant #AwayRobbery. And we’ll be boycotting Austin Away in 2021 as well.\n\nOh, and in case you’re wondering, we did the math.\n\n* In 2017, ECS regular season away tickets averaged $28.47 (High: PDX $47)\n* In 2018, ECS regular season away tickets averaged $32.13 (High: PDX $48)\n* In 2019, ECS regular season away tickets averaged $33.24 (High: PDX $49)\n* In 2020, ECS tickets would have averaged $32.78 before pandemic postponements\n\nIn 2021 so far, ECS tickets average $43.63. Oh, until you remove Austin, then it’s $32.67. We cannot, in good conscience, charge members a ticket price almost 40% higher than **any regular season match** in the last five years. Hell, Austin is charging almost $20 more than ECS members paid for the 2019 MLS Cup Final at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsee more [https://www.weareecs.com/multimedia/category-news/456-soccer-for-all-austin-2021](https://www.weareecs.com/multimedia/category-news/456-soccer-for-all-austin-2021)",

They'll be happier to get more people tickets from off the waiting list and not have to deal with security calls, buffer rows, etc. I hope we can get some kind of MLS mandated max price or something, otherwise I think away tickets will continue to get more expensive for everyone except in the stadiums where games don't sell out.",

And while it’s awesome to see it continue to grow, part of what makes this site special is the community that focuses on soccer fans supporting other soccer fans. \n\nAt the end of the day, I’ve always believed you can root against a team while still welcoming their fans into your stadium. And maybe since I’ve been outside Portland for years and spend the majority of my time as a visiting fan, I continue to appreciate this sentiment. With the extent of toxicity and divisiveness present in society, it’s important to remember all of us want to see soccer in the US flourish. And nothing indicates a healthier soccer landscape than people spending resources to follow their team outside of its home base. \n\nWhen I began tracking MLS away culture back in 2011, the only outlets that provided away fan content were either decaying forums with infrequent posts or irritating social media pages that stoke the flames of antagonism. And during this time, I also began to realize that the average soccer fan does not understand away day basics including where away sections are located or how well fanbases do travel despite considerable distances between venues. \n\nUpon diving into Reddit culture in 2016, I sought to help change that. This sub is not much, and admittedly my gf and family still don’t exactly comprehend what I spend my Saturdays perusing the interwebs trying to find. But it’s my small way of giving back to the wider soccer community. \n\nI appreciate all the positive feedback we’ve received and I am always open to suggestions to make this community more interesting and insightful. I’m contemplating ideas to generate more high-quality content, including potentially providing a small commission to photographers or fans at every stadium to submit high def photos on a weekly basis. But as of now, this is purely theoretical.\n\nBest of luck to everyone’s teams - except for the 90 minutes when they play mine ;)\n\n~ u/NewRCTID22",

            "description": "I've seen a lot of questions and inquiries into the behind the scenes aspects and the general experience of away travel in MLS, so I wanted to cover a few things here. \n\n**How it works:**\n\nAs you all know, each team has a designated away section for opposing fans, which unlike Europe, is pretty uncommon in US sport outside of College Football and College Basketball. As a result, these away sections are poorly publicized, so general fans typically have no idea they exist or have no idea how to access them (hence, the purpose of this sub). While many have complained about it here (to which I agree), this is by design. Most clubs only provide official supporters groups avenues to occupy the away sections for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. Supporters groups are more likely to provide a proper headcount which means the front offices can allocate resources accordingly.\n\n2. Supporters groups are more likely to congregate together before/after the match, which makes it easier to be escorted in and out more efficiently (and with minimal chance of issues). Simply put, the FO's don't want opposing fans to wander aimlessly in and around the stadium.\n\n3. The FO's are generally lazy as hell, don't prioritize away support in any shape or form, and simply don't want to do the legwork. An official group of supporters is likely to be more organized, and thus, is more likely to...well....organize for them. \n\nConsequently, each major supporters group has/should have a traveling liaison (or in some cases, multiple traveling liaisons). Their job involves two basic things:\n\n* Work with the home team's ticket office to allocate the proper amount of tickets. (I made this sound simple, it is often anything but)\n\n* Initiate communications with the home team's FO to outline schedules for entrance/exit and detail what is expected of away supporters (i.e guidelines for unacceptable behaviors). This typically happens via conference call, and should always take place before tickets get sent to the traveling fans so that this information can be sent alongside the tickets.\n\nIf your traveling liaison does the first bullet point but not the second bullet point, they should be fired and replaced *immediately*.\n\n**Tips:**\n\nOver recent years, as away supporters culture continues to grow, clubs are getting better at providing the proper resources for away fans. With that said, it could be wayyy better in many cases. Consequently, the burden falls on you, the traveling fan.\n\n**DON'T:**\n\n* Take anything outlined in the unacceptable behaviors for granted. \n\n*If they say no cursing, don't curse. From my experience, the security/ushers know the difference between a slip of the tongue and ejectable profanity. With that said, don't push it. They have every right to throw you out, so be mindful of yourself. And yeah, don't steal seats.*\n\n* Believe you can act like a home fan\n\n*Goes along the same lines as above. You are a guest, act like one. Whether the home fans are doing something acceptable is not the point; you are held to a different standard. Don't complain if anything is unfair, because the guidelines should have been made clear.*\n\n* Give the security any reason to dislike you\n\n*If shit hits the fan, which it probably won't, they are on your side. Don't give them a reason to do their job a little less effectively.*\n\n**DO:**\n\n* Thank the security and FO\n\n*In my experience, they open up to quick conversations. If they don't, no worries, but be sure to give them a thank you or a handshake on the way out. You not only represent your club and fanbase, but all traveling supporters in MLS. They don't want trouble as much as you do, and y'know, just being a decent human being can go a long way.*\n\n* Utilize the away section if you can\n\n*As I mentioned before, it can be difficult if you're not part of a supporters group, but I suggest you try anyways. Contact the ticket office to see if you can get away section seats - in many cases, it works. If not, get as close as you can. Nothing ruins a match experience like five obnoxious opposing supporters sitting in the middle of a home section (and vice-versa). This is an acceptable form a segregation, and I guarantee, it's a much better experience for all parties.*\n\n* Keep in mind that the league doesn't particularly care for away fans (at least as much as home fans)\n\n*Over the past few years, when incidents occur, the away fans are always blamed regardless of what truly happened. It's just easier; the home teams and MLS HQ's would rather ban traveling supporters to \"solve the problem\" than jeopardize the relationships with the home supporters groups. I can provide examples if need be.*\n\nAnd lastly....\n\n* Travel to away matches!\n\n*I tell everyone it's the most fun you can have as a supporter. Seeing different stadiums, teams, and supporters cultures while having the unique us vs them feeling is incredibly gratifying. The Timbers have only won once on my travels, but each experience was memorable.*\n\n**Other notes:**\n\nI'm glad to see this sub is still growing, and I thank you all for your support. One quick thing: I disabled the downvote button on desktop for a reason. I don't want to make too big a deal out of it, but I ask to please refrain from downvoting. I'm not sure why people do it, but if it's because you downvote based on a dislike for any given team/supporters group, you should definitely stop. While it's no secret I dislike certain teams/fanbases, I want to share their traveling support as much as I would my own team. We're all in this together, and we all want to see the away supporters culture grow - there's no \"sides\" to it.\n\nAdditionally, I want to open up this comment section for questions about anything revolving away supporters travel: I'm fairly sure I can answer it. My DM's are always open for inquiries as well.\n\n",

Although Section 228 is apparently (partially) reserved for away supporters, they've already allocated solid chunks of that section to home supporters. I suppose what they're not telling us - and this is pure inference - is that they'll have to move home supporters in order to meet the 150 tickets that MLS sets aside for away support. Obviously, that's a logistical challenge, and one they may not be keen on executing.\n\nAs a result, if you call/email the Austin ticket office to get away section tickets, **they'll likely tell you just to purchase random seats on the [(exorbitantly expensive)](https://seatgeek.com/portland-timbers-at-austin-fc-tickets/mls/2021-07-01-8-30-pm/5357949?utm_medium=partnership&utm_source=austinfc_ticketing&utm_campaign=web) secondary market.** Traditionally, this method is the best way to get away tickets, especially if you're not in a supporter's group, but it isn't looking like a viable option right now.\n\nIf you want to be with your fellow away supporters, the best solution at this point is to follow guidance from your supporter's group. I know the Timbers Army is in the midst of getting us an allocation for both of our away matches in Austin this summer, and I've heard they're confident they'll get one even if this process has dragged on for a while. \n\nI'll follow up again - if people are interested - once I have my away tickets. Because I'm not willing to spend a couple hundred dollars on SeatGeek to sit isolated in a home section.",

The Austin ticketing department is doing everything for the first time, and I think some of the changes related to COVID might have crossed things up even further.

I feel for those of you who had away tickets to matches during the 30 day time period, and I know there was going to be a few strong away contingents. I sure as hell will miss updating this site, especially after the long offseason.\n\nHopefully, the world will resume normality soon (if we even know what that is) and away attendance won't falter too much.

            "description": "I hope this isn't breaking any rules as I'm just trying to provide a friendly tip.\n\nWith Nashville SC now in the fray, I'm sure lots of people will mark Nissan Stadium on their calendar as a destination trip. Nashville can be a bit pricey, especially with hotel accommodations as it's has turned into a huge tourist city the last 10+ years. To keep a visit affordable, look into staying at a hostel. I've stayed at the [Nashville Downtown Hostel](https://www.nashvilledowntownhostel.com/) about 4 times on various road trips from Dallas and had a great time each visit. The only thing that sucks is parking but I've usually found free parking, at most, a 10 minute walk away. It's right across the Cumberland River from Nissan Stadium and in a very walkable part of the city.\n\nI'm not trying to strictly promote this one since I know there is another hostel available but this is the only one I've experienced. Feel free to ask me any questions!",

Is it just silver foil over the stadiums until you scratch - then it shows the team logo? The map of USA with a 28 silver circles is kind of weird. Especially with teams bunched to the edges of the map (middle America is pretty empty). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously - not my cup of tea. I'm sure you'd sell a few.
