        "description": "Tl;dr at the bottom\n\nSo, I\u2019ve been obsessively logging every* film I\u2019ve watched from September 1999 (when I was 19) all the way to today.\n\nThis has come up a handful of times in various film-related threads here on Reddit and several Redditors have expressed an interest in seeing the whole log. \n\nSo, I\u2019m posting it now, for your entertainment, astonishment, bafflement, ridicule, etc.\n\nTo try and preempt some potential questions:\n\nThere is a 20 month gap between the end of Feb 2001 and October 2003. During this period, I switched from pen and paper to an Excel document. But then the laptop I was keeping it on crashed, irrevocably, and since I was too dumb to have kept a back up, those 20 months are lost forever.\n\nThe most films I ever watched in a single day (not counting short films) is 10, on 8th May 2021.\n\nThe most films I ever watched in a single month is 89, in October 2023.\n\nThe most films I ever watched in a single year is 737, in 2023.\n\nThe longest unbroken streak of days is 590 days, between 30th July 2022 and 10th March 2024, where I watched 1,159 films in those 590 days.\n\nSince the start of 2020, I\u2019ve been logging on Letterboxd as well as my pen and paper log. I\u2019m planning to work backward and get everything logged in LB going back to Sept 1999, but that\u2019s a big job and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll find the time to do it.\n\nLink to my LB is below, but I should warn you in advance, I literally only use it as a logging tool. I don\u2019t follow back, I don\u2019t write reviews, I sometimes put lists together for various purposes, but it\u2019s almost exclusively for logging, so there really isn\u2019t much point in following me, but you are welcome to do so if you wish.\n\nhttps://boxd.it/IRhX\n\n\nTl;dr - I\u2019ve been logging every* film I watch since September 1999. I\u2019ve mentioned this a handful of times in various film-related Reddit threads and people have encouraged me to post the entire log, so now I am, for your entertainment, bafflement, ridicule, whatever.\n\n*I\u2019m missing a 20 month chunk due to my own stupidity, so it\u2019s not quite \u201cevery\u201d film.\n\n",

It discusses and satirizes some pretty heavy topics, considering the... maniacal toon energy. And it's fun!! \n\nYou've probably already seen it, but Rango is a really visually beautiful movie. \n\nIf you're going to get to see the new Nosferatu movie with your parents soon, I recommend watching the original from 100 years ago + The Shadow Of The Vampire as a sort of triple feature with it.\n\nEdit: not a movie but you might also really enjoy watching \"The Movies That Made Us\" on Netflix, each episode is basically a mini-documentary about the making of an older movie. Pretty much any documentary or video about the making of movies, screenwriting, special effects, directing, and/or camerawork will make the movie watching experience more interesting and fun even for movies you're seeing for the 100th time!",

They are beautifully animated and incredibly complex. *Fantastic Planet* is another cool animation, this one from the 70s. \n\n*Coherence* and *Man from Earth* are some good head scratchers and incredibly low budget.\n\n*2001: A Space Odyssey* is slow and weird, but visually stunning. \n\nCoen Brother's films, especially *O Brother Where Art Thou* are hilarious, and kind of surreal.\n\n*Amelie* , *Harold and Maude* and *Everything is Illuminated* are all unique, funny, and a bit profound  \n\nMake an effort to see and many different genres, from countries, and time periods.  There's good stuff to be found everywhere. Be open to the classics, too, even corny and campy things can have some gems.\n\n\nAlso, be aware that some of the other movies being recommended are some incredibly violent and disturbing ones. Some of them are still very good, but remember that a movie doesnt need to shock. I overlooked 'tame' movies for too long\n\nBut, being new to movies, I'd suggest sitting some of those out for now, I think you'll appreciate them more later.",

It could be Stan Brakhage's \"Mothlight.\" Or  Kenji Mizoguchi's \"Sansho the Bailiff.\" Or Satjiyat Ray's \"Prather Panchali\" series. Or Jaques Tati's \"Playtime.\"\n\nAnd honestly, the effect your looking for may not come in your teens or twenties, it may only come when you're much older and after you've seen a lot of great films.

Is it the snappy dialogue, the way scenes look, particular actors? Then seek out more work by those performers, directors etc. \n\nThink of sampling the suggestions as going wide. Use identifying what you like to go deeper. \n\nI started where you were when I was 14 or so. I just decided I wanted to learn about \u201cold movies\u201d which at that time were movies from the 1930s through 1950s that still aired on tv all the time. Couldn\u2019t rent videos, no internet, so I read a lot of books about old Hollywood and watched for movies to come on so I could watch them. And just built out from there, mostly around actors and actresses I liked.\n\nAt the same time I started going to movies currently out every chance I got. The first time I identified a current movie doing something I\u2019d seen in an old movie I was tickled to death. Being able to trace trends and styles and see when a newer director is doing a homage to something older is one of the pleasures of knowing about movies.",

It's not at all over the top or melodramatic: it's all fairly accurate.  The only thing INNACURATE about it, is you're far more likely to see young women turn to straight prostitution than doing amateur porn to pay for their habit, so really, the truth is worse than fiction.\n\nI watched it when I was ~22 and it made me uncomfortable, but after being an EMT for 5 years and dealing with addicts every single day, it's a pretty good depiction of how bad people can get.",

It\u2019s a non linear biased narrative of a man as seen by the people in his life. What changes in who he is and what doesn\u2019t change, from age 8-80, the whole movie is trying to discover \u201cWho is Charles Foster Kane\u201d and\u2026it gives you some idea, certainly more than the other characters. \n\nBut beyond that the look, the LOOK!! It set the template for film noir as it was developing. The (apparent)  size and scale of the sets is incredible, the makeup effects look great today, and the speed that it moves through the story is so fast, but never confusing. \n\nI really recommend watching it once as is and then again soon after with the Roger Ebert commentary track. This movie is 10 years ahead of everything else at the time (1941) and feels modern today. \n\nFrom there, you can check out writer and director\u2019s and actors who were influenced by Citizen Kane. \n\nWelcome to a large world, kid. It\u2019s a fun ride.",

One of the earlier 'disconnected converging storylines ' movies that I don't think has been surpassed. One second you are laughing, next second you are in despair. Amazing cast.\n\nThe Killer , John Woo 1989. Not to be confused with the recent (terrible) remake or other movies of same name, blends over the top action with excellent characters and story.\n\nEverything , Everywhere all At Once. Gives you hope that creativity isn't dead.\n\nCassablanca. The story. The chemistry. The writing.\n\nIron Giant. Great story and surprisingly mature and moving animated film",

This is not exhaustive and it's subjective of course, but it's the movies for each type that completely stuck in my mind and blew me away and I hope it'll help you explore your tastes.\n\n\n\nFor foreign stuff I'll recommend Lives of Others, Parasite, the experiment (the original german, not the remake) and goodbye lenin\n\nIf you like fantasy, Lord of the Rings trilogy is a must.\u00a0\n\nInteresting Directors with interesting styles:\u00a0\n\n- tarantino: pulp fiction, kill Bill, inglorious basterds\u00a0\n\n- villeneuve: arrival, dune part 1 and 2, sicario (the first two are scifi and the visuals will blow you away, the last one is very different)\n\n- wes anderson: Royal tenenbaums. Grand Budapest Hotel\u00a0\n\n- Nolan: batman trilogy, oppenheimer, inception\u00a0\n\nBlockbuster/popcorn cinema: ET, Jurassic Park, indiana jones (all Spielberg), pirates of the Caribbean, mask of zorro (ok the last one is just a personal fave of mine but its really good I promise)\u00a0\n\nDo you like 'end of days action spectacle movies'? Then I'd go with deep impact, the day after tomorrow, independence day (first one)\u00a0\n\nDramas: moonlight, I tonya, ladybird, spotlight, three billboards outside ebbing missouri, dead poets society, hidden figures, schindlers list, shawshank redemption, the color purple\n\nThriller: Seven, get out (last one more horror), there will be blood, deus ex machina\n\nGangster/Mafia/crime: godfather part 1 and 2, scarface, goodfellas, gomorrha, American gangster, no country for old men, LA confidential, the departed, heat\u00a0\n\nAction: die hard, man on fire, end of watch, the first 2 Bourne movies, top gun, nice guys, district 9, Pacific rim, training day\u00a0\n\nOlder movies: breakfast at tiffanys, the network, chinatown, the good the bad and the ugly, the lions in winter, Kramer vs Kramer, all the presidents men, the way we were, citizen kane, 12 angry men, sophies choice\n\nRomance/period: Notting Hill, pride and Prejudice, sleepless in seattle, far from the madding crowd, brooklyn, plus one (watched the last one recently and loved it so recommend it here), crazy stupid love, definitely maybe\u00a0\n\nComedy: anchorman, game night, nobody, seven psychopaths\n\nWar: saving private ryan, apocalypse now, thin red line\u00a0\n\nThere is also horror/slasher but I'm not that well versed in the genre, would say scream, texas chainsaw massacre, saw, the witch, hereditary though\u00a0\n\nWhat I'd say 'weird/distinct/watch it because it's different stuff': fargo, don't look up, memento, the menu, promising young women, the favourite, triangle of sadness\u00a0\n\nAnd then there are family movies like animated etc but that may be a whole other post, plus also musicals which is another",

                "comment": "You remind me of myself at your age. My first real introduction to cinema was \nA Clockwork Orange (Kubrick, 1971). I saw that the summer after I graduated sixth grade and it changed me. I would 1000% recommend that. On that note, here\u2019s an incomplete list that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love:\n\n1: A Clockwork Orange (Kubrick, 1971). Yes, I already mentioned it but I cannot recommend this one enough. Kubrick is arguably thee most important modern director, and this one is his magnum opus. More than any other movie, this may be the one you\u2019re looking for.\n\n2: Taxi Driver (Scorsese, 1976). Scorsese is a giant in the New Hollywood cinema movement, possibly surpassing Coppola. This guy has managed to remain relevant form more decades than any other director I can think of, and Taxi Driver is definitely one of his most important and seminal works. A must see.\n\n3: Blue Velvet (Lynch, 1986). This one is a doozy. I first saw this when I was in Junior High, and holy mackerel, it blew me away. David Lynch studied abstract expressionistic painting in college, and his training shows in a lot of his films. It can be seen in his big screen debut Eraserhead (1977), his tour de force Mulholland Drive, and even his television masterpiece Twin Peaks (1990). Blue Velvet, though experimental, remains accessible and even has a coherent plot. \n\n4. Naked Lunch (Cronenberg, 1991). Yep! This is where I got my user name.  The Fly (1986) may be Cronenberg\u2019s best known film, but Naked Lunch is probably his best, and definitely has life changing potential. Unlike Kubrick, Scorsese, and Lynch who are all cinema auteurs, Cronenberg is more what you\u2019d call a vulgar auteur, that is an artist who can split the difference between gravitas and popcorn sensibilities.\n\n5: Hausu (Obayashi, 1977). I really should have mentioned this one in the top three, but here we are at number 5. Hausu is an experience. Seriously, it is possibly the most visually spellbinding motion picture ever made. After the enormous success of Jaws (Spielberg, 1977), the Japanese production company Toho (responsible for Godzilla) wanted a Jaws of their own. They tapped commercial director Nobuhiko Obayashi for the gig, who in turn asked his five year old daughter for story ideas. The result was a haunted house movie that feels like a high speed Lisa Frank fever dream. \n\n6: The Boxers Omen (Kuei, 1983). This one is rowdy. I mean mean really really rowdy. No movie can match Hausu in terms of psychedelic visual overload, but this one tries. It teeters schizophrenically between slapstick puppet show and grindhouse exploitation. Imagine watching a Bruce Lee flick, but not knowing what planet you\u2019d woken up on. But be warned, more than any others on this list, this one gets a little intense. \n\n7: The Peanut Butter Solution (Rubbo, 1985). This is my personal favorite movie of all time, and I would have opened with this, but it\u2019s a kids movie and I didn\u2019t want you to think I was throwing you a softball just because you were 14. That being said, this one is a gem. And don\u2019t let the fact that it\u2019s a children\u2019s film fool you. It was directed by a man with a background in radical political documentaries and shadow directed by Vojt\u011bch Jasn\u00fd who was an important member of the Czech New Wave. Like Hausu, this one was co-written by the directors child. The script began as a stream of consciousness bed time story that Rubbo made up with his son each night, and it shows. Just when you think you know where this movie is headed, you don\u2019t. This flick is dreamy, dreamy, dreamy.\n\n8: The Devils (Russell, 1971). This is the best movie about nuns that will ever be made. Period. Ken Russell is a visionary gift from another planet. Great sets, brilliant acting, marvelous script, and the greatest crocodile cameo in cinema history. \n\n9: Natural Born Killers (Stone, 1994). Oliver Stone is as irregular and unpredictable as they come. He wrote the screenplay for Scarface (DePalma, 1983) \ud83e\udd73, but he also directed World Trade Center (2006) \ud83e\udd28. Natural Born Killers was the movie he was sent to this planet to make. Watching it is like following the story of Bonnie and Clyde purely through channel surfing. It\u2019s cinema, it\u2019s television, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s own thing. A wholly singular experience. AND it\u2019s got an amazing soundtrack co-produced by none other that Trent Reznor and Dr. Dre. \n\n10: Starship Troopers (Verhoeven, 1997). Paul Verhoeven is another vulgar auteur, arguably an even more blatant example than Cronenberg. This one is a total cineplex film, through and through. People may even balk that it\u2019s making a top ten list. But you asked for life changing and shocking films, and Verhoevens filmography has those in spades. He\u2019s a Dutch director who cut his filmmaking teeth making more \u201cart house\u201d films, but once he got to Hollywood, he banged out an impressive slate of pictures that, despite their obvious mainstream appeal, all had something visceral and beautiful bubbling beneath their surface. Robocop (1987) and Showgirls (1995) could just as easily taken the tenth spot on this list, but I feel Starship Troopers is probably the best entry point to Verhoevens work there is. It\u2019s screenplay is tighter than Chinatown (Polanski, 1974) or Die Hard (McTiernan, 1988)\u2026 yes I said it, fight me\u2026 it does a great job of incorporating multimedia storytelling, the humor is solid, and visually stands apart from virtually any other sci-fi I\u2019ve ever seen. 10/10",

It is all streaming 24/7 on services these days\u2026\n\nIf the kid wants \u201csomething so amazing that it can change his life\u201d\u2026.maybe try to dig a bit deeper into the archives\u2026\n\nTry almost anything by John Waters (i.e Polyester although not near as much fun to watch without the scratch and sniff cards) or David Lynch (i.e Eraserhead). Hilarious and weird and way ahead of the times when released\n\nKing of Hearts was always a good one for me...but maybe too old.\n\nFrancis Coppola did Godfather and everybody knows that, but Rumblefish or Outsiders was two pix he did that were super cool when I was a kid\u2026\n\nOther older (sic) movies like Lone Star by John Sayles is goddamn wonderful with a ton of seriously great film craft and a great story\u2026\n\nIf you want a good Coen Bros movie try Blood Simple or Raising Arizona  and you will then know where they began to make a name for themselves\u2026\n\nIt would be fun to know what you have watched that you currently find interesting\u2026there is so much great stuff that has been made that nobody talks about anymore\u2026",

If you liked it, you can go with The Hobbit trilogy afterwards, but it's not the same. \n\n-Blade Runner (1982): one of the darkest sci-fi movies, with a deep meaning if you listen to the dialogues.\n\n-Starship Troopers (only the first one, ignore there are more of them): action, giant bugs and a criticism of authoritarian governments.\n\n-Ghost in the Shell (1996 original animation, not the live action): a classic of anime films.\n\n-My neighbour Totoro: another classic of anime films, but in a completely different style.",

                "comment": "It's pretty interesting when you look at it.\n\nBack in the 80s and 90s there were (roughly) three types of movies made. The true independent low budget, the AAA tent pole movies, and finally (what I call) the mid tier movie. Star Power but not as big as AAA but not independent either \n\nThis is where Miramax, Touchstone, Cannon and Caroloco sat.\n\nWhere there actual role was to experiment and create something risky and different. It made going to the movies diverse.\n\nBy the time around I'd say the mid 90s, studios would greenlight flicks and if it didn't make it in box office it would go through the secondary DVD market which was very lucrative especially for quirky smaller pictures with a cult following.\n\nWhen DVDs and physical media started to dry up and streaming started to trend that secondary market was lost, which has the indirect consequence of placing all the financial burden on box office \n\nThis meant mid tier movies were no longer green lit as you couldn't predict if they would actually make money.  And the over analysis of market data created the template for the perfect cookie cutter 4 quadrant movie. That was expanded upon with the logic if you have the perfect template, then if you give it more money it will return more money. Coupled with this happening around the lightening in a bottle that was the MCU and you had the perfect storm. Spending 200 to 300 million (at that time) returned 1 billion or more.\n\nThis also consequentially diminished the importance of the \"movie star\" (Tom Cruise being one of, if not the last official one).\n\nIt worked until it didn't and the cycle repeats. Same way as the big musicals of the 50s and 60s were too expensive and died. And that ushered in new blood such as Spielberg, Coppola, De Palma, and Lucas ... which is way the 80s (imo) was so cinematic.  To be fair, might be somewhat rose colored as this was the era I grew up in.\n\nBut that's to say we are starting to see the change, with A24 and Bloomhouse being two of the studios to watch for their knack of finding those current mid tier stories that are connecting with users.\n\nTLDR; Movies have gone from being creative to being content and content never inspires longevity but simply a return to being creative. As that is the heart of Art.",

                "comment": "Film studios are no longer interested in taking risks on unique stories and are instead keen on making huge profits. For example, studios are less likely now to produce a $15mil film with the hopes of making that back plus some. It\u2019s no longer enough for studios to just make a profit; they want to make a HUGE profit to appease their shareholders. Let\u2019s say after all is said and done, the studio takes home $30mil in profit off of that one $15mil film, their profit doubling what they spent albeit on a small scale. The film is a success and they go on to make sequels that also become successes. A win, right?\n\nWell that model is largely obsolete now with big studios. They\u2019ve shifted to a \u201clet\u2019s invest $200mil with the hopes of making $400-500mil+ profit\u201d mindset. This is largely what\u2019s led to what you describe - dull, predictable, stale, and creatively-bankrupt projects that all end up looking and feeling the same. They buy into formulaic methods of storytelling that leave us with cookie-cutter movies. Notice all the IP prequels, sequels, and reboots that have been plaguing the film industry for the past decade? It\u2019s because studios are placing their bets on making tons of money off properties that they know were already successful in the past. They\u2019re simply afraid of taking creative risks now and think that throwing mountains of money at something will make it good. Ironically many of these films fail miserably, which leads me to my next point.\n\nThe reason big budget films tend to flop more now is because studios prefer dumping money into cheap visual and narrative gimmicks hoping they can make a quick and big ROI rather than telling a good, original story. And when those films inevitably fail due to their lack of creative vision, they become even less inclined to take risks, leading to a downward spiral/self-fulfilling prophecy effect. To bring it back, this is why you\u2019re seeing all these prequels, sequels, and reboots of existing IPs now; studios think they can simply ride off their previous successes, not understanding what made the originals so great to being with: THE STORY. The thing about having a smaller budget is that it forces you to allocate funds more carefully, usually into the writing, which can lead to a more engaging film overall. The perfect recent example of this is with Godzilla Minus One, a film that had a budget of $10-$15mil and ended up making $113mil at the box office, roughly 10 times its budget. Why? Because their focus on writing a compelling narrative carried the film as opposed to an over reliance on CGI and done-to-death film tropes. Not to mention the director is a VFX artist, so he was able to head that department with keen oversight.\n\nThere are MANY other factors I could go on and on about, but this in my opinion is the root cause of why modern studio films all have that same, stale look and feel to them. They\u2019re only thinking about how they can potentially make a huge profit instead of telling a good story.",

Since eternal growth is impossible, in order to preserve their jobs, they know to aim any given movie's appeal at the widest part of the market bell curve, which is the middle. PG-13 movies that appeal to the maximum number of people and risk alienating the minimum amount of people is a very safe bet, mitigating the risk of loss. Unfortunately, while risk can lead to horrific disaster, it's also the only way to achieve excellence. But the risk of loss isn't mitigated by the potential for excellence when a reliable return can be extracted from mediocrity. That's why a capitalist-driven arts program of any kind will lean hard into mediocrity by the end of its life cycle, which is where we're nearing, at least in terms of \"Hollywood,\" the institution. That's my take, anyway.",

Months later, there'd be a DVD (or for us Olds, a vhs) release, which would generate further income. These were, for the most part, relatively known figures/projections, and they'd be used to establish a budget. Essentially, his point was that there was more appetite for studios to take on riskier projects, as they knew there'd be at least two  opportunities to make back the investment. With streaming, its less clear on how studios will make money, so they're less likely to invest in something that isn't guaranteed to draw in a theatrical audience.",

It'd have worked. \n\nBut instead of taking on the subject head on. \nLike\nIn WWII the Nazis made concentration camps and death camps, etc. \nA gentile business man saved people by employing them in his factories. It looked like one thing to the Nazis. It was something else.\nHe saved some people and didn't get killed. \n\nIt simultaneously acts like people don't know that Nazis Bad and Look How Shocking We Can Be. Nazis Bad. We get it. Get on with the film now. \nThe result is this pretentious film in black and white and colour. That has a rather artificial tone. You don't need to add to the horror. It's already there.",

        "description": "Finally got around to watching \"Jackie Brown\", and wow, what an experience! I knew it would be great, being Tarantino, but it honestly exceeded my expectations.\n\nThe plot itself is deceptively simple but perfectly layered. Pam Grier plays Jackie, a flight attendant who\u2019s down on her luck and caught in a dangerous game between her boss (a smooth yet menacing gunrunner played by Samuel L. Jackson) and the feds, who want to use her to take him down. What I love is how Jackie\u2019s story unfolds\u2014she\u2019s smart, resourceful, and incredibly resilient, but also feels grounded and real. Watching her navigate the increasingly tense situations, manipulating both sides, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.\n\nAnd then there are the supporting characters\u2014Robert Forster\u2019s Max Cherry is a standout, bringing this quiet, unassuming charm that makes his growing connection with Jackie so believable and endearing. De Niro and Bridget Fonda, too, add layers of dark comedy, playing off each other in scenes that are bizarrely hilarious and tense all at once.\n\nTarantino\u2019s signature style is here, but it\u2019s toned down just enough to let the characters breathe. The pacing is slower, more deliberate, which works beautifully with the heist setup and the twists that follow. Plus, the soundtrack is just brilliant\u2014soulful, nostalgic, and so fitting for every scene.\n\nFor me, Jackie Brown deserves way more love and recognition. It\u2019s got all the elements of a classic Tarantino film but with a subtler, more nuanced edge. Absolutely loved it\u2014definitely giving it a 9/10!",
